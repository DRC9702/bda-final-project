{"Charlie Savage": [{"idx": 1, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/us/politics/fisa-surveillance-fbi.html", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 When a long-awaited inspector general report about the F.B.I.'s Russia investigation became public this week, partisans across the political spectrum mined it to argue about whether President Trump falsely smeared the F.B.I. or was its victim. But the report was also important for reasons that had nothing to do with Mr. Trump.\nAt more than 400 pages, the study amounted to the most searching look ever at the government's secretive system for carrying out national-security surveillance on American soil. And what the report showed was not pretty.\nThe Justice Department's independent inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, and his team uncovered a staggeringly dysfunctional and error-ridden process in how the F.B.I. went about obtaining and renewing court permission under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, to wiretap Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser. \n\"The litany of problems with the Carter Page surveillance applications demonstrates how the secrecy shrouding the government's one-sided FISA approval process breeds abuse,\" said Hina Shamsi, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union's National Security Project. \"The concerns the inspector general identifies apply to intrusive investigations of others, including especially Muslims, and far better safeguards against abuse are necessary.\"\nCongress enacted FISA in 1978 to regulate domestic surveillance for national-security investigations \u2014 monitoring suspected spies and terrorists, as opposed to ordinary criminals. Investigators must persuade a judge on a special court that a target is probably an agent of a foreign power. In 2018, there were 1,833 targets of such orders, including 232 Americans.\nMost of those targets never learn that their privacy has been invaded, but some are sent to prison on the basis of evidence derived from the surveillance. And unlike in ordinary criminal wiretap cases, defendants are not permitted to see what investigators told the court about them to obtain permission to eavesdrop on their calls and emails.\nAt a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Mr. Horowitz's report on Wednesday, both Republicans and Democrats suggested that legislation tightening restrictions on FISA surveillance may be coming, and the A.C.L.U. submitted ideas to the committee.\nCivil libertarians for years have called the surveillance court a rubber stamp because it only rarely rejects wiretap applications. Out of 1,080 requests by the government in 2018, for example, government records showed that the court fully denied only one.\nDefenders of the system have argued that the low rejection rate stems in part from how well the Justice Department self-polices and avoids presenting the court with requests that fall short of the legal standard. They have also stressed that officials obey a heightened duty to be candid and provide any mitigating evidence that might undercut their request.\nBut the inspector general found major errors, material omissions and unsupported statements about Mr. Page in the materials that went to the court. F.B.I. agents cherry-picked the evidence, telling the Justice Department information that made Mr. Page look suspicious and omitting material that cut the other way, and the department passed that misleading portrait onto the court.\nTo give just three examples:\nFirst, when agents initially sought permission for the wiretap, F.B.I. officials scoured information from confidential informants and selectively presented portions that supported their suspicions that Mr. Page might be a conduit between Russia and the Trump campaign's onetime chairman, Paul Manafort. \nBut officials did not disclose information that undercut that allegation \u2014 such as the fact that Mr. Page had told an informant in August 2016 that he \"never met\" or \"said one word\" to Mr. Manafort, who had never returned Mr. Page's emails. Even if the investigators did not necessarily believe Mr. Page, the court should have been told what he had said.\nSecond, as the initial court order was nearing its expiration and law-enforcement officials prepared to ask the surveillance court to renew it, the F.B.I. had uncovered information that cast doubt on some of its original assertions. But law enforcement officials never reported that new information to the court.\nSpecifically, the application included allegations about Mr. Page contained in a dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent whose research was funded by Democrats. In January 2017, the F.B.I. interviewed Mr. Steele's own primary source, and he contradicted what Mr. Steele had written in the dossier. \nThe source for Mr. Steele may, of course, have been lying. But either way, officials should have flagged the disconnect for the court. Instead, the F.B.I. reported that its agents had met with the source to \"further corroborate\" the dossier and found him to be \"truthful and cooperative,\" leaving a misleading impression in renewal applications.\nFinally, the report stressed Mr. Page's long history of meeting with Russian intelligence officials. But he had also said that he had a relationship with the C.I.A., and it turns out that he had for years told the agency about those meetings \u2014 including one that was cited in the wiretap application as a reason to be suspicious of him.\nThat relationship could have mitigated some suspicions about his history. But the F.B.I. never got to the bottom of it, and the court filings said nothing about Mr. Page's dealings with the C.I.A. \nThe inspector general's report contains many more examples of errors and omissions. Mr. Horowitz largely blamed lower-level F.B.I. agents charged with preparing the evidence, but he also faulted high-level supervisors for permitting a culture in which the inaccuracies took place.\nAnd while Mr. Horowitz obtained no documents or testimony showing that the inaccuracies stemmed from any political bias \u2014 as opposed to incompetence and negligence \u2014 he also rejected as \"unsatisfactory\" the explanation that the agents were busy on the larger Russian investigation and that the Page wiretap order was only a small part of their responsibilities.\nStill, it is undeniable that the agents and supervisors compiling materials for the Page wiretap application were under far more pressure than in routine counterintelligence investigations. Both in terms of the stakes and the tempo, the early Russia investigation may have had more in common with a counterterrorism investigation. \nBut that factor also raises the question of what goes into applications for wiretaps in lower-profile cases. Indeed, everyone involved in the Page wiretap knew that what they were working on was likely to come under close scrutiny, yet they still repeatedly failed to follow policies.\nMr. Horowitz also said senior-level supervisors bore responsibility for permitting systemic failures to fester, and his office has begun a broader audit of unrelated FISA applications. \nHis expos\u00e9 left some former officials who generally defend government surveillance practices aghast.\n\"These errors are bad,\" said David Kris, an expert in FISA who oversaw the Justice Department's National Security Division in the Obama administration. \"If the broader audit of FISA applications reveals a systematic pattern of errors of this sort that plagued this one, then I would expect very serious consequences and reforms.\"\nOn rare occasions, the public has caught glimpses of problems with the information that goes into FISA applications. \nIn 2000, the Justice Department confessed to errors in F.B.I. affidavits submitted in 75 surveillance and search applications related to major terrorist attacks, a FISA court opinion disclosed. \nThe court met \"to consider the troubling number of inaccurate F.B.I. affidavits\" and barred an unnamed F.B.I. agent from making affidavits before the court. In response, the F.B.I. came up with far more rigorous internal procedures, pledging to ensure the accuracy of FISA affidavits by more carefully reviewing them. \nBut when Mr. Horowitz's investigators looked at the underlying files for the Page applications, they found errors and omissions that showed that the F.B.I. had not scrupulously followed those procedures.\nThe government has fought hard to keep outsiders from seeing what goes into its FISA applications. In 2014, a federal judge in Illinois ordered the government to show a defense lawyer classified materials about the national security surveillance of his client, which would have been the first time a defense lawyer had been given such materials since Congress enacted FISA in 1978. \nBut the Obama administration appealed, and an appeals court overturned the order, agreeing that letting the defense counsel see the application would create an intolerable risk of disclosing sensitive government secrets.\nThat stands in contrast to how wiretapping works in ordinary criminal law. Targets are usually told when the surveillance ends. If they are prosecuted based on evidence gathered from the wiretap, they get to see what was in the application so their defense lawyers can argue that the government made a mistake and the evidence should be suppressed. \nThe prospect of that adversarial second-guessing gives criminal investigators a reason to be scrupulous about what they put into their requests for wiretaps. In the absence of that disciplining factor, the government has developed heightened internal oversight about what goes into FISA applications. \nBut that system demonstrably failed in the Page wiretap. \nThe report should call into question the legitimacy of the FISA system \"whether you like Trump, hate Trump, don't care about Trump,\" Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said at the hearing on Wednesday.\n\"I'd hate to lose the ability of the FISA court to operate at a time probably when we need it the most,\" Mr. Graham told Mr. Horowitz. \"But after your report, I have serious concerns about whether the FISA court can continue unless there's fundamental reform.\""}, {"idx": 2, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/us/politics/barr-dea-bulk-collection.html", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Two Democratic senators asked the Justice Department's internal ethics watchdog on Thursday to investigate Attorney General William P. Barr for blessing a secret program at the Drug Enforcement Administration more than a quarter-century ago that went on to collect billions of records of Americans' phone calls.\nThe senators \u2014 Ron Wyden of Oregon and Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont \u2014 accused Mr. Barr, during his first stint as attorney general, of approving \"an illegal, bulk surveillance program\" in 1992 \"without conducting any legal analysis\" of it. \n\"Mr. Barr's authorization of this sweeping surveillance program without requiring, at minimum, an appropriate legal analysis, was not consistent with his oath to support and defend the Constitution and it likely amounted to professional misconduct,\" the senators wrote to the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility. \nA spokeswoman for Mr. Barr did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe letter comes at a time when Democrats have frequently criticized Mr. Barr for aligning himself with President Trump's attacks on the F.B.I.'s Russia investigation and for supplying legal defenses for aggressive White House moves, like invoking emergency powers to spend more on a border wall than Congress appropriated and defying subpoenas. \nAgainst that backdrop, the letter portrayed Mr. Barr as having a history of willing to undermine the rule of law in service of expansive uses of executive power.\nMr. Barr approved the call records program in January 1992, when he was attorney general under President George Bush. It continued and expanded under the presidencies of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama before then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. ended it in 2013.\nThe Justice Department disclosed the program's existence after it ended, in a 2015 court filing, and it was later the subject of a detailed investigative report by USA Today. In March, the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General issued a report about the program that included new details about it.\nMr. Holder shut down the program amid the uproar following the leaking of the existence of a similar National Security Agency bulk phone records program by Edward J. Snowden, a former intelligence contractor, in June 2013.\nUnlike the N.S.A. program, which collected bulk logs of purely domestic phone calls to be analyzed in hunting for hidden terrorist cells, the Drug Enforcement Administration program collected bulk logs of outgoing international phone calls from the United States to countries deemed to be linked to narcotics trafficking. \nBut the legal theory behind both programs was similar: The government secretly interpreted statutes allowing law-enforcement officials to gather records deemed to be \"relevant\" to an investigation as also permitting systematic, bulk collection of American's communications logs. That theory was aggressive, and a federal appeals court later rejected it in a case challenging the N.S.A. program that Mr. Snowden had brought to light.\nIn the case of the D.E.A., the agency obtained the records by issuing administrative subpoenas to phone companies. The program had no court oversight and relatively few internal rules and controls for how the data could be used. \nBy contrast, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court issued orders to the phone companies that they provide their customer records to the N.S.A., and the court imposed many more rules on how that data could be used \u2014 although the N.S.A. had technical troubles complying with those rules and frequently violated them, documents declassified after Mr. Snowden's leaks showed.\nAfter Mr. Barr's original tenure, the D.E.A. eventually came to share its massive databases with other law-enforcement agencies for querying about matters that did not involve drug cases. It also later invoked the same legal theory to use administrative subpoenas to collect bulk data about Americans' purchases of money-counter machines, the report from the Office of the Inspector General disclosed.\nCiting that report, Mr. Wyden and Mr. Leahy suggested Thursday that Mr. Barr had abused his powers as attorney general by authorizing the counternarcotics agency to use administrative subpoenas to collect Americans' call records in bulk without conducting an appropriate legal analysis of the idea first.\n\"Attorney General Barr knew, or should have known, that neither statutory law nor federal case law permitted the D.E.A. to sweep up, in bulk, billions of records of Americans' telephone communications,\" they wrote."}, {"idx": 3, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/us/politics/visa-applications-social-media.html", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A pair of documentary film organizations sued the Trump administration on Thursday over its requirement that foreigners disclose their social media accounts \u2014 including pseudonymous ones \u2014 when they apply for visas. \nThe lawsuit, which raises novel issues about privacy and surveillance in the social-media era, challenged a rule the State Department put into effect this year. The requirement grew out of President Trump's campaign promise of \"extreme vetting\" and his early executive orders that barred travel into the United States from several Muslim-majority nations. \nIn particular, the lawsuit argues, forcing people from authoritarian countries to disclose the pseudonyms they use to discuss politically sensitive matters could endanger them by creating a risk that the information gets back to their own governments. As a result, it said, they will be less likely either to express themselves on social media or to apply for visas. \n\"Many people use pseudonyms on social media so that they can speak anonymously about sensitive or controversial issues, and so that they can shield themselves or their families or associates from possible reprisals by state or private actors,\" the plaintiffs wrote. \"The registration requirement effectively conditions their eligibility for U.S. visas on their readiness to surrender their online anonymity.\"\nThe Trump administration announced the rule in 2018 and started enforcing it this year. The State Department changed its visa application forms to require applicants to disclose all identifiers they have used on any of 20 social media platforms for the past five years, including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. The rule covers about 14.7 million people who apply for a visa each year. \nThe complaint, filed in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, challenged both the State Department, which administers visa applications, and the Department of Homeland Security, which it says uses visa application data for other purposes, including administering immigration law.\nThe Trump administration did not immediately comment on the lawsuit. But in a pair of postings, Twitter expressed opposition to the State Department rule, saying it chilled free speech.\nThe complaint maintains that administration officials improperly developed the rule \u2014 arguing that they failed to point to evidence that it would be effective and necessary \u2014 and that it violates the Constitution by chilling rights of free speech and association. \nVisa applicants \"must consider the risk that a U.S. official will misinterpret their speech on social media, impute others' speech to them, or subject them to additional scrutiny or delayed processing because of the views they or their contacts have expressed,\" the lawsuit said.\nDemanding the data also creates the risk that authoritarian and other rights-abusing governments, \"including some U.S. allies,\" may use it to unmask anonymous dissidents, it said.\n\"Those who use pseudonymous identifiers must take into account that they will have to relinquish their online anonymity to U.S. officials when they submit their visa applications, and they must also consider the risk that U.S. officials will disclose their social media identifiers to foreign governments, reveal the identifiers inadvertently, or fail to protect the identifiers from third parties who might access them unlawfully.\"\nThe lawsuit was jointly developed by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. They are representing the two documentary film organizations \u2014 Doc Society, based in Brooklyn, and the International Documentary Association, based in Los Angeles \u2014 that host conferences and workshops that bring foreign filmmakers and social activists to American soil.\nWhile most of the people affected by the new rule are foreigners abroad, who generally do not have constitutional rights, the lawsuit noted that the requirement also covers people with substantial ties to the United States, including people already residing on domestic soil \u2014 like foreign students and foreigners with work permits \u2014 who renew their visas while abroad.\nSince the change took effect, visa applicants from abroad have been compelled to disclose to American consular officials all social-media handles or user names they have used on major platforms, 12 of which are based in the United States: Facebook, Flickr, Google+, Instagram, LinkedIn, Myspace, Pinterest, Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, Vine and YouTube. \nThe forms also ask about a Russian service, VK; a Belgian one, Twoo; a Latvian one, Ask.fm; and five Chinese sites: Douban, QQ, Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo and Youku. \nThe forms do not require applicants to turn over their passwords to see nonpublic information. But the complaint stresses the risk created by forcing people to turn over pseudonymous accounts, citing partners of the plaintiffs who have used them to \"conduct sensitive research for a film about Nazis online, including joining discussion groups and contacting members of known Nazis' families\" and a member from Syria who \"uses pseudonymous accounts as a safety measure against political persecution.\"\nThe lawsuit said some partners and members of the plaintiffs are now self-censoring, including deleting old posts that criticized the Trump administration's policies. Others \"are no longer applying for U.S. visas \u2014 and are forgoing personal, educational, and professional opportunities\" because they fear the consequences of disclosing their social media accounts.\n\"The government simply has no legitimate interest in collecting this kind of sensitive information on this immense scale, and the First Amendment doesn't permit it to do so,\" said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the Knight Institute."}, {"idx": 4, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/us/politics/turley-impeachment.html", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Are House Democrats making a mistake by moving swiftly to impeach President Trump when some facts remain hidden about whether he abused his power in the Ukraine affair?\nThat was the argument put forward on Wednesday by Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law professor who was the only Republican-selected witness of four legal scholars who testified at the House Judiciary Committee's opening impeachment hearing.\nMr. Turley's point crystallized the constitutional dilemma facing Congress as it pushes forward on impeachment rather than pausing to go after additional evidence the White House has withheld. A president willing to dig in and stonewall subpoenas for documents and testimony can use the courts to run out the clock, undermining the House's ability to use its impeachment power in practice.\nCalling \"the abbreviated period of this investigation\" both problematic and puzzling, Mr. Turley said Congress had assembled \"a facially incomplete and inadequate record in order to impeach a president.\" The evidence has gaps because of \"unsubpoenaed witnesses with material evidence,\" he argued, and it is wrong to move forward without hearing from them.\nDemocrats have conceded that they would like to obtain more documents and hear more testimony from Mr. Trump's key aides, but they have also argued that the evidence they have is sufficient to impeach him \u2014 and said it is absurd for the White House to contend their case has holes when it is thwarting their access to more information.\nThe chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, noted Mr. Trump's stonewalling and said that Congress \"must act now\" because the president had \"made clear that if left unchecked,\" he would again ask a foreign government to intervene in the American election.\n\"While the Republican witness may not be convinced that there is sufficient evidence that the president engaged in these acts, the American people and the majority of this committee disagree,\" Mr. Nadler added.\nWhen a president systematically blockades congressional subpoenas and instructs current and former aides not to provide documents and testimony, that is another basis to impeach, argued another witness, Michael J. Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor and author of \"The Federal Impeachment Process: A Constitutional and Historical Analysis.\"\n\"In this situation, the full-scale obstruction of those subpoenas, I think, torpedoes separation of powers and, therefore, your only recourse is to, in a sense, protect your institutional prerogatives, and that would include impeachment,\" Mr. Gerhardt testified.\nNotably, Mr. Turley \u2014 who said he had not voted for Mr. Trump \u2014 did not assert the president did nothing wrong, as hard-core supporters of the president have done. He said that a now famous call in which Mr. Trump pressured Ukraine's president to announce investigations that could benefit him politically \"was anything but perfect,\" and that Congress had a legitimate reason to scrutinize it.\nBut, he argued, it is premature to rush forward with impeachment while Congress has yet to obtain potentially knowable facts about what Mr. Trump said to his aides about withholding a White House meeting and $391 million in military aid that Ukraine desperately needed to shore up its defenses against Russian aggression.\nMuch of the evidence the House uncovered in its inquiry was from witnesses who largely were a degree of separation removed from Mr. Trump himself. As a result, they were unable to say whether the president ever directly and explicitly said he was conditioning a meeting and the securing of funding for the specific purpose of coercing Ukraine's president into announcing investigations that would benefit him politically.\nIn his longer written statement, Mr. Turley named three men who interacted directly with the president and might know more about what Mr. Trump said behind closed doors about Ukraine: Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, John R. Bolton; his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani; and his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney.\nMr. Bolton is known to have opposed what Mr. Giuliani was doing for Mr. Trump with Ukraine, met directly with Mr. Trump to discuss the frozen aid to Ukraine in August and has coyly indicated that he knows something important that Congress does not yet know.\n\"There remain core witnesses and documents that have not been sought through the courts,\" Mr. Turley wrote, adding that the House \"is moving forward based on conjecture, assuming what the evidence would show if there existed the time or inclination to establish it.\"\nBut Mr. Turley made only a passing reference in his written statement to the problem that has bedeviled impeachment investigators: The White House has directed top aides to Mr. Trump not to cooperate with the House, while asserting that they are immune from being subpoenaed to testify about their discussions with the president.\nMr. Bolton, for example, has refused to testify unless and until a judge orders him to, and has made clear he will file a lawsuit to put the matter into court if he receives a subpoena rather than deciding for himself whether Congress's claimed power to compel his testimony, or the president's claimed power to block lawmakers from receiving it, should prevail.\nThe Trump legal team's claim of absolute immunity for top presidential aides has been a losing one in court. A Federal District Court judge already rejected it in a 2008 case involving a congressional subpoena to Harriet Miers, President George W. Bush's former White House counsel. Another trial judge rejected it again late last month, in a case centering on a subpoena to Donald F. McGahn II, Mr. Trump's former White House counsel.\nBut the legal unraveling of Mr. Trump's argument has been a slow process. The opening stage of the fight over the subpoena to Mr. McGahn consumed nearly a third of the year before the judge completed a 120-page ruling rejecting it. The Justice Department then immediately appealed. It can repeat that process before a three-judge panel, and then again before the full appeals court and then before the Supreme Court. \nAnd even if the Supreme Court ultimately orders such an official to show up for testimony, he could then refuse to discuss conversations with Mr. Trump on the ground that their contents are privileged. That would start a new cycle of litigation.\nThat means that for the witnesses Mr. Turley identified as having potentially material additional information, the Justice Department would very likely be able to keep the subpoena tied up in court until long after the 2020 election.\nBut Mr. Turley said that Mr. Trump was \"allowed\" to go to court and that it would be an abuse of power for Congress to treat that as an impeachable act of obstruction. He pointed to lower-court rulings against the president in subpoena cases like Mr. McGahn's as \"an example of what can happen if you actually subpoena witnesses and go to court\" \u2014 even though those lower-court rulings took months to achieve and were immediately appealed.\nAgainst that backdrop, Pamela S. Karlan, a Stanford law professor invited by Democrats to testify who said Mr. Trump should be impeached for abusing his powers, suggested that the decision facing lawmakers was a \"gut\" call. \nReferring to a piece of evidence Mr. Trump's allies do not dispute \u2014 the White House's record of a July 25 call between Mr. Trump and Ukraine's president \u2014 she invoked an analogy: the governor of a state hit by a hurricane or flood asking for a meeting with the president to discuss disaster assistance provided by Congress. She asked what would happen if the president replied: \"I would like you to do us a favor. I'll meet with you and I'll send the disaster relief once you brand my opponent a criminal.\"\nMs. Karlan said: \"Wouldn't you know in your gut that such a president had abused his office, that he betrayed the national interest and that he was trying to corrupt the electoral process? I believe that the evidentiary record shows wrongful acts on that scale here.\"\nStill, the White House call record was not that explicit. Mr. Trump did respond to the Ukrainian president's mention of military assistance by saying \"I would like you to do us a favor, though\" and then talked about his desire for investigations, including into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, but the call record does not show that Mr. Trump explicitly made such investigations a condition for the meeting and the military aid. \nThe question facing Congress, then, is whether the available record, while imperfect, is nevertheless sufficient to fairly deduce that Mr. Trump was the architect of a quid pro quo \u2014 or whether to wait for the distant prospect of someday obtaining more facts through court.\nRepublicans on Wednesday ran in part with Mr. Turley's theme. Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the committee, emphasized that the facts of what Mr. Trump did are disputed, unlike those during the Nixon and Clinton impeachment proceedings.\n\"There are no set facts here,\" Mr. Collins said, adding: \"This is not an impeachment. This is simply a railroad job.\""}, {"idx": 5, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/27/us/politics/trump-legal-strategy.html", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Critics of President Trump cheered on Monday when a federal judge ruled that the former White House counsel Donald F. McGahn II must testify to Congress \u2014 and scathingly labeled \"fiction\" the administration's arguments that top White House aides are immune from congressional subpoenas.\nIndeed, the outcome was the latest in a string of lower-court losses for Mr. Trump as he defends his stonewalling of lawmakers' oversight and the impeachment investigation. Other fights are playing out in the courts over Mr. Trump's financial records and grand-jury evidence in the Russia investigation.\nBut from a realist perspective, Mr. Trump is winning despite losing.\nThat is because it is now late November \u2014 not May, when Mr. McGahn, on Mr. Trump's directions, first defied the subpoena, or even August, when the House asked the judge, Ketanji Brown Jackson, to enforce its subpoena.\nThe proceedings before Judge Jackson consumed nearly a third of the year as she took briefs, conducted oral arguments and then composed a 120-page opinion. And her ruling was merely the end of the first step. \nThe Justice Department immediately filed an appeal and sought a stay \u2014 virtually ensuring that the fight over Mr. McGahn will remain bogged down for the foreseeable future. (On Wednesday, Judge Jackson placed a hold on her ruling to consider the stay motion.) And even if Mr. McGahn someday is forced to show up, a new cycle of litigation will inevitably start over whether specific information he might testify about is subject to executive privilege.\nMeanwhile, time is on Mr. Trump's side. The realistic window for Congress to consider impeaching him is closing, with the 2020 election less than a year away. If the overriding goal is to keep information from coming out while his term and potential re-election hang in the balance, the Trump legal strategy is succeeding despite all the adverse rulings.\n\"This is not about putting down markers for all time \u2014 it's more about particular short-term objectives,\" said Martin Lederman, a Georgetown law professor who worked on executive-power issues as a lawyer in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel.\nLike a football team up late in a game whose defense hangs back to prevent big plays while letting its opponent make shorter gains, Mr. Trump's legal team is looking to run out the clock, putting forth aggressive legal theories often backed by scant precedent. The strategy risks periodic bad headlines in the short term and could lead to definitive rulings that hamstring future presidents \u2014 but it is demonstrably advantageous for consuming time.\nThe theories include asserting that Congress lacks legitimate legislative authority to conduct oversight of whether government officials are engaged in wrongdoing, even though lawmakers have done so for generations; that impeachment investigators cannot gain access to grand-jury evidence, even though an appeals court permitted just that during Watergate; and that senior presidential aides are immune from subpoenas, even though a judge rejected that theory in 2008.\nHouse Democrats have turned to the courts at an unprecedented tempo in their clashes with Mr. Trump, and they went into court on Tuesday to file yet another case \u2014 this one challenging the administration's defiance of a subpoena for documents about its attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. But they are also growing disillusioned with the courts as a solution.\nThe Democrat leading the investigation into the Ukraine affair, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, has made clear that lawmakers will move forward with weighing articles of impeachment rather than getting bogged down in courts. He used another sports metaphor, the tactic of boxers who lean against the ring ropes and trick their opponents into exhausting themselves by ineffectively pummeling them.\n\"We are not willing to go the months and months and months of rope-a-dope in the courts, which the administration would love to do,\" Mr. Schiff said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, explaining that he and his colleagues view their investigation as urgent because Mr. Trump has solicited foreign interference in the 2020 election. Because of that, Mr. Schiff said, they will not wait even for witness testimony and documents they would like to obtain.\nIndeed, in another major court development on Monday that got far less attention than the McGahn lawsuit, the Supreme Court blocked an appeals court ruling that the House can subpoena Mr. Trump's financial records while the justices consider whether to hear the case \u2014 alongside a similar case involving the Manhattan district attorney's push for such records. \nBoth cases generated headlines when district court judges and then appeals courts ruled against the president. But if the Supreme Court does take the appeals, justices may issue no final judgment until the court's term ends in seven months.\nMr. Trump suggested he instead had a more principled motive than running out the clock on Tuesday, claiming in a series of tweets that he would be happy to let his current and former aides tell Congress what they know, and insisting that he is only blocking them from talking to ensure that \"future Presidents should in no way be compromised.\"\n\"I am fighting for future Presidents and the Office of the President,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Other than that, I would actually like people to testify.\"\nHis claim that he is blocking aides from disclosing what they know because he wants to strengthen the institution of the presidency over the long term echoes justifications of other presidents in previous disputes, like the George W. Bush administration's range of efforts to expand presidential power.\nThe men who drove that Bush agenda \u2014 Vice President Dick Cheney and his top lawyer, David S. Addington, a key leader on the administration legal team \u2014 held longstanding ideological views about executive power, said Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard professor who led the Office of Legal Counsel in the Bush administration. \nBut \"that is not true of Trump, I don't think,\" Mr. Goldsmith said, noting that Attorney General William P. Barr, who believes in stronger executive power as a lifelong principle, is an exception. Instead, the Trump administration's legal positions \"seem like short-term tactical moves,\" Mr. Goldsmith said. \nMuch of the line where Congress's power stops and the president's begins is blurry, with few definitive precedents. That ambiguity gives presidents freedom to maneuver. But, Mr. Goldsmith warned, if an aggressive president pushes an extreme theory all the way to the Supreme Court, it can risk a definitive ruling tying future presidents' hands.\nThe danger for the institution of the presidency, Mr. Goldsmith said, is that \"really aggressive assertions of executive power often end up creating bad executive power precedents.\"\nTo be sure, Mr. Trump may also be hoping that the Supreme Court \u2014 with its majority of five justices appointed by Republicans now including two by him \u2014 could eventually rule for him, just as it ultimately voted, 5 to 4, to permit a watered-down version of his travel ban even though lower courts had blocked it.\nMany administrations have sometimes made privilege and immunity claims to fend off or delay congressional attempts to pry information out of the executive branch, Mr. Lederman noted. But prior presidents, unlike Mr. Trump, were willing to resolve disputes through negotiation and compromise long before they could reach the Supreme Court.\n\"If the Supreme Court justices decide they want to drag these disputes out, they can,\" Mr. Lederman said."}, {"idx": 6, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/25/us/politics/mcgahn-testimony-ruling.html", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The former White House counsel Donald F. McGahn II must testify before House impeachment investigators about President Trump's efforts to obstruct the Mueller inquiry, a judge ruled on Monday, saying that senior presidential aides must comply with congressional subpoenas and calling the administration's arguments to the contrary \"fiction.\"\nThe 120-page decision by Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia handed another lower-court victory to House Democrats in their fight to overcome Mr. Trump's stonewalling. \n\"Presidents are not kings,\" wrote Judge Jackson, adding that current and former White House officials owe their allegiance to the Constitution. \"They do not have subjects, bound by loyalty or blood, whose destiny they are entitled to control.\" \nThe Justice Department, which is representing Mr. McGahn in the lawsuit, will appeal, a spokeswoman said. Still, the ruling by Judge Jackson, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, could have broader consequences for the investigation into the Ukraine affair. \nIn rejecting the Trump administration's sweeping claim that top presidential advisers, as Mr. McGahn was, are absolutely immune from being compelled to talk about their official duties \u2014 meaning they do not even have to show up \u2014 the judge said the same is true even for those who worked on national security issues. \nNotably, John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, has let it be known that he has significant information about the Ukraine affair at the heart of the impeachment inquiry but is uncertain whether any congressional subpoena for his testimony would be constitutionally valid. He wants a judge to decide. \nJudge Jackson's ruling also came on the same day that another federal judge in Washington held out the possibility that more documents about the Ukraine affair could yet see the light of day, ruling that emails between the White House and the Pentagon about the freezing of military aid to Ukraine should be released under a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.\nBut even as those rulings suggested that more potential evidence for impeachment investigators might become available as the cases play out, House Democrats said the Intelligence Committee would deliver a report soon after Thanksgiving making the case for impeaching Mr. Trump, moving forward rather than waiting for the inevitable appeals to drag on. \nDemocrats are compiling a list of \"noncompliance with lawful subpoenas\" as part of the report so the Judiciary Committee can consider drafting an article of impeachment charging Mr. Trump with obstructing Congress, the intelligence panel's chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, wrote in a letter to colleagues on Monday.\nIndeed on Monday, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked an appeals court ruling in another case that required Mr. Trump's accounting firm to turn over financial records to another House committee while justices decide whether to take the case. If they do choose to hear arguments, the justices might not issue a final ruling on the matter until late June.\nSeveral potential witnesses to what Mr. Trump said and did to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations that could benefit him politically \u2014 like Mr. Bolton and Mr. Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney \u2014 have declined to testify because the administration instructed them not to, claiming that current or former senior officials are constitutionally immune.\nMr. Bolton, who met alone with Mr. Trump about why he was freezing a military aid package to Ukraine in August, has threatened to sue if Democrats try to compel him to testify, seeking a court ruling about whether such a subpoena is legally valid. \nA lawyer for Mr. Bolton, Charles J. Cooper, has previously argued that Mr. Bolton's situation is different from Mr. McGahn's because Mr. Bolton's official duties centered on foreign affairs and national security matters. But Mr. Bolton's intentions and desires are unclear.\nMr. Bolton has become an enigmatic figure in the impeachment drama. According to other testimony, he strongly opposed the Ukraine pressure campaign and told aides to report what was going on to White House lawyers. He left the White House under rancorous circumstances in September and has since criticized Mr. Trump's foreign policy.\nBut it remains unclear what he would tell impeachment investigators if he were to appear, and House Democrats are nervous that he is such a wild card he could just as easily hurt their case as help it. He accused the White House last week of not giving him back his Twitter account when he left, then teasingly asked if it was \"out of fear of what I may say?\"\nIn her ruling, Judge Jackson appeared to respond to Mr. Cooper's notion. She wrote that the law required not just Mr. McGahn, but also \"other current and former senior-level White House officials\" who receive a subpoena to appear \u2014 and that it made no difference if they worked on domestic or national security matters.\nStill, she emphasized, her ruling is only about whether Mr. McGahn must show up to be asked questions. It leaves unanswered whether the questions that lawmakers want to ask him \u2014 primarily about conversations with Mr. Trump detailed in the Mueller report \u2014 are subject to executive privilege, suggesting that even if Congress ultimately wins a Supreme Court ruling forcing Mr. McGahn to show up, the litigation process might have to start all over again.\nThe House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Mr. McGahn in May after the release of the report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. It showed that Mr. McGahn was a key witness to several of the most serious episodes in which Mr. Trump sought to obstruct the Russia investigation.\nBut Mr. Trump, who had openly vowed to block \"all\" oversight subpoenas after Democrats took control of the House in the 2018 midterm election, instructed Mr. McGahn not to cooperate.\nIn August, the House Judiciary Committee sued Mr. McGahn, seeking a judicial order that he comply with the subpoena. That same day, the panel also asked a judge for an order permitting it to see secret grand jury evidence gathered by Mr. Mueller, which Attorney General William P. Barr declined to provide to Congress. (Another federal judge ruled for Congress in the grand jury case a month ago, but the administration has appealed.)\nThe court filings said the House needed the information not just for oversight purposes, but also for an impeachment inquiry. While the impeachment focus has since shifted to the Ukraine affair that burst into public view in September, House Democrats are still considering an article of impeachment that would accuse Mr. Trump of obstruction of justice.\nA question pervading both disputes is whether the Constitution permits Congress to subpoena aides to a president like Mr. McGahn and, potentially, Mr. Bolton, to talk about their official duties \u2014 or whether the president's secrecy powers make his aides absolutely immune from such subpoenas.\nAdministrations of both parties have taken the position that \"Congress may not constitutionally compel the president's senior advisers to testify about their official duties,\" as a 15-page legal opinion from Steven A. Engel, the head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, put it. But there is no definitive court precedent on the issue. \nIn 2008, another Federal District Court judge, John D. Bates, rejected that theory in a subpoena dispute. He ruled that President George W. Bush's former White House counsel Harriet Miers had no right to skip a hearing for which she had been subpoenaed. Judge Bates, a Bush appointee, said she had to show up \u2014 although she might still refuse to answer specific questions based on a claim of executive privilege.\nBut because the Miers dispute was then resolved before an appeals court weighed in, Judge Bates's opinion does not count as a controlling precedent for other disputes raising the same issue. That left the Obama administration, in a 2014 memo, free to take the position that Judge Bates had been wrong, and the Trump legal team echoed that logic.\nIn declaring that absolute immunity from congressional subpoenas for senior-level presidential aides \"simply does not exist,\" Judge Jackson spoke scornfully of the memos by the Office of Legal Counsel, sometimes called O.L.C., saying otherwise. \n\"Absolute testimonial immunity for senior-level White House aides appears to be a fiction that has been fastidiously maintained over time through the force of sheer repetition in O.L.C. opinions, and through accommodations that have permitted its proponents to avoid having the proposition tested in the crucible of litigation,\" she wrote."}], "Katie Benner": [{"idx": 7, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/us/politics/justice-dept-legal-opinions-trump.html", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department has released several internal legal opinions that could help bolster President Trump's claim of executive privilege in barring Congress from interviewing witnesses and collecting documents from the executive branch. \nThe legal opinions were written during previous Democratic and Republican administrations by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which provides legal opinions for the executive branch. Some of them had not been made public until they were posted to the department's website on Thursday.\nCNN first reported the publication of the opinions.\nThe department cited the opinions in a recent case before Federal District Court involving the former White House counsel Donald F. McGahn II, whom the administration had said was \"absolutely immune\" from complying with a congressional subpoena issued in the House impeachment investigation.\nJudge Ketanji Brown Jackson of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled last month that Mr. McGahn must testify before House investigators about whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct the Russia inquiry. Judge Jackson said in her 120-page decision that the administration's arguments to the contrary were \"fiction.\" \nThe Justice Department appealed the ruling. \nIn its defense of Mr. McGahn, the department cited Office of Legal Counsel opinions written during the Reagan, Bush, Clinton and Obama administrations that say that presidents can exert privilege to keep executive branch communications private. \nThe Office of Legal Counsel, which is overseen by Steven A. Engel, made the opinions public after the House requested them as part of its lawsuit against Mr. McGahn, according to a Justice Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to openly discuss that decision-making process.\nAmong the opinions cited in the McGahn case was one titled, \"History of Refusals by Executive Branch Officials to Provide Information Demanded by Congress,\" written by Theodore B. Olson, who ran the Office of Legal Counsel during the Reagan administration and is now a partner at Gibson Dunn.\n\"The memorandum seeks to show that presidentially mandated refusals to disclose information to Congress \u2014 though infrequent \u2014 are by no means unprecedented acts of this or any other administration,\" he wrote.\nThe memo listed examples of presidents refusing congressional requests for information or other forms of cooperation dating to the 1700s, and having those claims upheld. More recently, Mr. Olson noted that President John F. Kennedy directed the defense secretary and all personnel under him to not give the Senate any testimony or documents that would reveal the names of aides who had made or recommended changes in specific speeches.

Barr recently approved making public new details about a former F.B.I. informant at the heart of conservatives' allegations about the Russia investigation, deciding to release information that had been blacked out in a highly anticipated inspector general's report due out on Monday.\nA representative from the office of the Justice Department inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, told the former F.B.I. informant, Christopher Steele, on Sunday that the Justice Department had decided to allow for the release of the information, two people briefed on the situation said late on Sunday.\nMr. Steele was given no details about the information itself, nor was he told how it would affect the report's portrayal of him, the people said. Mr. Horowitz is expected to be critical of Mr. Steele, a British former spy who compiled a dossier of salacious, unverified information about President Trump. F.B.I. officials relied to some degree on the dossier to seek a court order for a wiretap of a former Trump campaign adviser, and the president's allies have seized on the issue to make broad claims about the sprawling Russia investigation.\nThe notice to Mr. Steele on the eve of the report's release was highly unusual. Like the other witnesses interviewed for the inspector general's report, Mr. Steele had earlier reviewed the findings that are pertinent to him, and he was given a chance to comment on them. In this case, Mr. Horowitz's office did not detail for him the additional information and gave him no opportunity to respond for the report to be released on Monday.\nSpokeswomen for Mr. Barr and Mr. Horowitz declined to comment. Mr. Steele did not respond to a request for comment.\nMr. Barr had pushed the F.B.I. in recent months to declassify the entire forthcoming report, arguing that it would be better for the findings to be as transparent as possible. That process has taken months and only recently wrapped up.\nIt was not clear why the information about Mr. Steele had originally been blacked out in Mr. Horowitz's report. Though Mr. Horowitz's office operates independently, the attorney general and other senior law enforcement officials routinely review its reports to black out sensitive details like information that is classified or involves a continuing investigation. \nDuring his investigation, Mr. Horowitz asked witnesses about an assessment of Mr. Steele by MI6, the British spy agency, which it provided to the F.B.I. after the bureau had received the Steele dossier. MI6 officials described Mr. Steele as honest but said that he sometimes pursued targets that others believed were a waste of time, two people familiar with the assessment have said.\nMr. Steele's dossier claimed that Russian intelligence officers had used blackmail and bribery to try to turn Mr. Trump into a source, and Mr. Horowitz's investigators examined whether law enforcement officials improperly relied on it to seek a wiretap for the former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page, who visited Russia during the campaign. \nMr. Steele has made clear to associates that he considered the dossier to be a starting point for further investigation, not established facts. It has grown clear in the years since Mr. Steele compiled his dossier that while many Trump aides welcomed contacts with Russians, some of its most sensational claims appeared to be false or were impossible to prove.\nThe more than 400-page inspector general's report is expected to debunk the idea that the F.B.I. relied on the Steele dossier to open its Russia investigation, though it was used to apply for the warrant to wiretap Mr. Page. It is not clear the extent to which the application for the warrant relied on the dossier.\nMr. Trump's allies have emphasized that Mr. Steele compiled the information for a research firm, and that the firm was paid by lawyers who worked for Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee. They have argued that it was inappropriate to use partisan opposition research in a sensitive application to wiretap a person associated with a presidential campaign.\nThe inspector general is expected to say that the Justice Department did not know the identity of Mr. Steele's patrons when they used some of his information in the original October 2016 application to wiretap Mr. Page. But he will be critical about the fact that law enforcement officials did not change the language about who paid for the research in later wiretap renewal applications, after officials learned that Democrats had funded the research, according to people familiar with a draft of the report.\nMr. Horowitz will also fault the F.B.I. for not telling the judges who approved the wiretap applications about potential flaws with the dossier.\nHe is also expected to criticize contact that Mr. Steele had with Bruce G. Ohr, a Justice Department official and Russian organized crime expert who shared information from Mr. Steele with the F.B.I. even after the bureau ended its relationship with him as an informant in the fall of 2016.\nMr. Ohr kept those meetings with Mr. Steele from his superiors, which Mr. Horowitz is expected to criticize. Mr. Ohr's wife also worked for the research firm that had hired Mr. Steele, Fusion GPS."}, {"idx": 9, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/09/us/politics/barr-durham-ig-report-russia-investigation.html", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 When the Mueller report was made public this spring, Attorney General William P. Barr seemed to try to blunt its findings, playing them down in an early summary and defending President Trump at a news conference just before its release. \nOn Monday, when the Justice Department's inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, rejected one of Mr. Trump's main attacks on the F.B.I. and declared the bureau had adequate reason to investigate the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, Mr. Barr again stepped in, issuing a statement saying that the F.B.I. instead should not have opened the investigation in 2016.\n\"The F.B.I. launched an intrusive investigation of a U.S. presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken,\" he said.\nIn both cases, Mr. Barr highlighted his belief that law enforcement officials overstepped their authority when they decided to investigate Trump campaign aides and that the president ultimately did nothing wrong. Mr. Barr long suspected that was the case before he became attorney general, and his time in office has crystallized his belief, friends and associates say.\nMr. Barr's willingness to side with Mr. Trump over law enforcement, even when it contradicts his own department's assessments, illustrates why he is one of Mr. Trump's most important allies. \nHis pronouncement on Monday comes at a time when the president is on the verge of being impeached over accusations that he abused his power. And Mr. Barr's past pronouncements that it is nearly impossible for the president to break the law when exercising his authorities have been adopted by Mr. Trump's allies as they try to push back on the impeachment inquiry.\nJohn H. Durham, a federal prosecutor whom Mr. Barr appointed to run a separate criminal investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation, backed Mr. Barr's findings in his own highly unusual statement. \"Last month, we advised the inspector general that we do not agree with some of the report's conclusions as to predication and how the F.B.I. case was opened,\" Mr. Durham said. \nHe also noted that he had access to more information than Mr. Horowitz did, an apparent reference to Mr. Durham's trips to meet with foreign intelligence officials overseas and to his examination of any role the C.I.A. played in how the F.B.I. confronted Russia's election interference in 2016. \nMr. Barr said in the statement that the report by the inspector general \"provided critical transparency and accountability.\" \nThe statements from the Justice Department's top official and one of his key investigators gave ammunition to Mr. Trump's supporters to dispute a major finding in the long-awaited report by Mr. Horowitz that was one of the few bright spots for the F.B.I. But it drew criticism from the F.B.I.'s supporters.\n\"I don't understand how Barr can on the one hand lavish praise on the inspector general and his team of lawyers and investigators, and in the next breath seek to undermine its key finding that the investigation was authorized and validly predicated,\" said Michael Bromwich, a former Justice Department inspector general who is now a lawyer in private practice. Mr. Horowitz has harshly criticized one of his clients, the former F.B.I. deputy director Andrew G. McCabe, for violations of the Justice Department's media policy. \n\"They either got it right or they didn't,\" Mr. Bromwich said. \nMr. Horowitz found that the F.B.I. had adequate reason in 2016 to lawfully open a full investigation into whether Trump campaign associates were wittingly or unwittingly helping Russia to interfere in the election. Called Crossfire Hurricane, the investigation eventually focused on four Trump campaign associates, two of whom were already the subjects of continuing Justice Department investigations. \nThe F.B.I. opened the inquiry amid a rash of leaked emails that had been stolen from the Democratic National Committee, and days after receiving intelligence that a Trump campaign adviser at the time, George Papadopoulos, had told Australian diplomats that a Russian had intermediary had offered information that could damage Hillary Clinton's campaign. \nOnly the tip from the Australian government was officially used \"to predicate the opening of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation,\" Mr. Horowitz said \u2014 and that was enough information to open the inquiry. His conclusion undercut accusations by the president and his allies that F.B.I. officials had carried out a politicized conspiracy to sabotage his campaign.\nMr. Horowitz also said that the F.B.I. followed all policies when it used informants to carry out that work. He noted that the bureau's standards were very low, and he initiated an audit of how it would handle applications to wiretap Americans citizens in the future.\nChristopher A. Wray, the director of the F.B.I., said that he accepted all of the report's findings, including that officials had enough reason to open the investigation, as did other F.B.I. defenders.\n\"The inspector general's report found that the F.B.I.'s Crossfire Hurricane investigation was supported by sufficient evidence to meet legal requirements,\" said Brian O'Hare, the president of the F.B.I. Agents Association.\nMr. Barr said in his statement that Australia, identified in the report only as a Friendly Foreign Government, had acted appropriately in sharing information with the United States. \n\"What was subsequently done with that information by the F.B.I. presents a separate question,\" Mr. Barr said. Neither he nor Mr. Durham presented evidence to show why the inspector general's conclusion was incorrect. \nIn criticizing the F.B.I., both Mr. Horowitz and Mr. Barr homed in on the fact that investigators continually omitted information from applications for a court order for a wiretap under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, that could have undercut their argument that they had probable cause to monitor Mr. Page's communications. \n\"F.B.I. officials misled the FISA court, omitted critical exculpatory facts from their filings, and suppressed or ignored information negating the reliability of their principal source,\" Mr. Barr said. \"The inspector general found the explanations given for these actions unsatisfactory.\"\nMr. Horowitz chronicled 17 occasions when investigators omitted key information or conveyed erroneous information to the court. He declined to say whether the court would have denied the application had it had a more complete and accurate picture.\nMr. Horowitz recommended that the F.B.I. review the performance of every person involved in the wiretap effort.\nMr. Wray said in his response that he had already taken steps to address the serious lapses that Mr. Horowitz had detailed, and that he would make significant changes to how the bureau manages its process of obtaining a secret wiretap and how it uses confidential human sources. \nMr. Barr said that he would take Mr. Horowitz's personnel recommendations seriously and \"follow all appropriate processes and procedures, including as to any potential disciplinary action.\""}, {"idx": 10, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/us/politics/barr-police.html", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Attorney General William P. Barr warned that communities and critics of policing must display more deference or risk losing protection, a stark admonition that underscored the Trump administration's support for law enforcement amid an ongoing national conversation about police brutality against minorities.\n\"They have to start showing, more than they do, the respect and support that law enforcement deserves,\" Mr. Barr said on Tuesday afternoon in comments at an awards ceremony for policing. \"And if communities don't give that support and respect, they may find themselves without the police protection they need.\"\nThe speech immediately sparked criticisms that Mr. Barr was conflating protests of police misconduct with a disrespect for the police and that he was advocating lawlessness as a potential reprisal. \n\"The idea that the attorney general of the United States, the nation's chief law enforcement officer, is recommending abandoning communities as retribution for pushing for police reform or criticizing policing practices, is profoundly dangerous and irresponsible,\" said Vanita Gupta, the president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the former head of the Justice Department's civil rights division. \nMr. Barr's stance amounted to a call to support police officers even when they abuse their power, another critic said. Mr. Barr \"fails to understand police are not a protection racket,\" Andrew Stroehlein of Human Rights Watch said on Twitter. \nAt the ceremony, Mr. Barr likened criticisms of the police to the abuse that Vietnam War veterans \u2014 many of whom were drafted and had to fight \u2014 endured when they returned home. Those troops sometimes \"bore the brunt of people who were opposed to the war,\" Mr. Barr said.\n\"The respect and gratitude owed them was not given,\" he said. \"It took decades for the American people to finally realize that.\"\nMr. Barr lauded police officers for their \"special kind of bravery\" and noted that beyond protecting communities and fighting crime, they often do the work of mental health professionals and drug addiction specialists.\nHe lamented that police officers did not receive the kind of cheers and support that the public had afforded returning war veterans. \"When officers roll out of their precincts, no crowds cheer them on,\" he said. \"When you go home at the end of every day, there is no ticker-tape parade.\"\nMr. Barr also echoed President Trump's attacks on critics of police abuse and the use of deadly force. Mr. Trump has said that the N.F.L. should \"fire or suspend\" players who knelt during the national anthem to protest police brutality and that police officers should not be \"too nice\" while transporting suspects. \nSome law enforcement officials denounced the president's comments as potentially encouraging the inappropriate use of force. \nMr. Barr's remarks reflected his calls earlier this year for zero tolerance for resisting the police and served as a reminder of his history as an ardent backer of aggressive law enforcement. \nDuring his first stint as attorney general, in the early 1990s during the George Bush administration, Mr. Barr supported tough-on-crime policies that furthered the incarceration of millions of Americans. Under his watch, the Justice Department issued a memo titled \"The Case for More Incarceration.\"\nMr. Barr has defended his work as partly responsible for an ensuing drop in violent crime. During his confirmation this year, Mr. Barr said that his push for more incarceration was in response to the burgeoning crack epidemic and noted that today's world may call for a different approach to drug addiction and violent crime. \nBut Mr. Barr has remained firm in his support of police officers and the need for them to be tough on crime. Earlier this year, he said, \"In the final analysis, what stands between chaos and carnage on the one hand, and the civilized and tranquil society we all yearn for, is the thin blue line of law enforcement.\""}], "Christine Hauser": [{"idx": 29, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/us/naval-air-station-corpus-christi.html", "text": "The Naval Air Station in Corpus Christi, Tex., was briefly locked down early Wednesday and a person was taken into custody.

It happened in Vegas. \nThe day started out typically, according to Bobby Lee, our story's main witness. On the afternoon of Dec. 5, he was on his way to the grocery store when he noticed something red outside his car window. \nPigeons were milling around a parking lot near a dumpster, pecking the ground. Ordinary behavior for the birds, but for one detail: Two of them were wearing miniature cowboy hats, one red and one gray.\nBaffled, he grabbed his phone. The \"birds have hats on, bro!\" Mr. Lee exclaimed in a 12-second video that he later posted on Facebook.\nMr. Lee, 26, said he threw some Doritos out the window for the birds, but it scared them off. They didn't go far; one settled on a ledge. On the internet, however, the cowboy-hat-wearing pigeons (watch out, pun incoming) took wing. \n\"It got a lot of attention fast,\" Mr. Lee said. \"The day after, I had a lot of news people texting me and people trying to buy my video.\" \nStoryful, which verifies and publishes material from social media, reached out to Mr. Lee and distributed the video. Local news organizations picked it up. \nKTNV asked the obvious, most pressing question: \"Who did this?\" \nBy Tuesday morning, the video had been viewed, shared and commented on hundreds of thousands of times.\nMr. Lee said he had no idea who had put the hats on the birds, though he noted one coincidence: The Wrangler National Finals Rodeo was in town. But the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association, which organizes the event, \"had nothing to do with the pigeons wearing cowboy hats,\" according to Scott Kaniewski, the editor of ProRodeo Sports News.\nThe mystery deepened. Animal welfare agencies contacted Mr. Lee, including Lofty Hopes, a bird rescue organization, which told him to stay on the lookout for the birds. Mariah Hillman, a founder of Lofty Hopes, said she had a second report of a sighting on Monday in the same area, as well as an unverified report of pigeons wearing hats in Reno.\nThe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said it \"does not appear to be a police matter at this time.\" A Clark County spokeswoman, Stacey Welling, had no immediate comment.\nOnline, people expressed worries about the pigeons' welfare. How were the hats staying on their heads \u2014 was it glue or some other adhesive? And were they cowboy hats, or top hats? (The New York Times's fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, was generous enough to make a determination: \"cowboy hats.\")\nCharles Walcott, a Cornell University ornithologist who has been studying the common pigeon for 30 years, agreed to do a deep dive into the work of the mystery bird milliner and answered some questions after being sent the video on Tuesday. Do the pigeons look O.K.? What shape are their skulls? How would a person go about putting a hat on a pigeon? \nHis first takeaways: \"I enjoyed the video. I just thought those pigeons with hats were cute.\"\nAfter watching the video, Dr. Walcott said he was not too worried. The pigeons strutted around and pecked for food or pebbles for their gizzards, apparently unperturbed by their headwear. Though they looked mature, he could not determine the age or gender of the birds.\n\"I think the thing that I would emphasize is I can't see that it is causing any great harm to the pigeons,\" he said. The hats are \"certainly light enough,\" he added. \"They look like happy pigeons to me. It is hard to know, of course, because they will not talk to us.\"\nBut pigeons are not conducive to hats. The shape of their skulls is \"fairly flattish but rounded,\" Dr. Walcott said, so a hat must be fitted on the surface of the bird's head. Whoever did that was apparently careful not to obscure the eyes, as far as Dr. Walcott could tell. \"They certainly are not impeding the pigeon's vision of things that it is pecking at on the ground,\" he said. \nBut the hats \"might get in the way of seeing a hawk coming down from on top.\"\nWhen Dr. Walcott was studying pigeons at Harvard in the 1960s, he and other scientists affixed light copper coils to the birds' heads to create magnetic fields that would help the researchers understand how the animals use signals to home. The coils were fastened with a veterinary cement, similar to chewing gum, that could be peeled off the birds' feathers. \n\"I would like to think that is what these folks used,\" Dr. Walcott said. \"But I bet it is not.\"\nPigeons are adaptable, he said, and they love big cities, with all the windowsills available for nesting. The hat-wearing pigeons in Las Vegas could be captured with simple wire cage traps, propped open with a stick and a rope attached to pull when the pigeon goes inside to eat. Or the hats might eventually fall off.\nMs. Hillman of Lofty Hopes, the bird rescue organization in Las Vegas, said in an interview that for five days, she and her team had been canvassing the east side of the city, handing out business cards and telling residents to call if they see the birds. Another person reported seeing the pigeons on Monday, she said, and they apparently still had their hats on.\n\"The hats can molt off, but that will take time,\" she said. \nAt this point, she and her staff are just guessing who fitted the pigeons with their accessories. \n\"Humans basically just need to keep their hands off animals,\" Ms. Hillman said. \"It is their life.

It was not clear how many shots were fired.\nTerry Schuster, a spokeswoman for the School District of Waukesha, said of the armed student in a telephone interview, \"He did not comply to hand over the gun.\"\nThe student was taken to a hospital and was in stable condition, the chief said. No one else was injured and investigators were not looking for additional suspects. A statement from the police department said officers provided \"lifesaving\" medical treatment to the student.\nThe officer who fired his gun is an 11-year veteran of the department, and appeared to have acted within state statute and departmental policy, Chief Jack said.\nThe chief and Ms. Schuster had no further information about the type of weapon the student had. \n\"This is clearly a superintendent's worst nightmare,\" the superintendent of the district, Todd Gray, said at the news conference. He said classes would resume on Tuesday. \nThe shooting raised fears at the school, one of the state's largest, with about 1,200 students in grades 9-12. \nStudents were told there was a lockdown drill and to shelter in classrooms. Dismissed early after the building was secured, some of them milled outside the building with their parents, television station WDTJ reported.\nKevin Kitslaar, the school principal, said in a statement to parents and guardians that the students and staff members responded quickly, evacuating from the hallway and into a locked classroom. \n\"At the same time, as the building was put into a lockdown, the Waukesha Police Department responded quickly to the building and the situation,\" he said in the statement, which was quoted by WDTJ.\nShawn Reilly, the mayor of Waukesha, which is about 20 miles west of Milwaukee, called it a \"terrifying day for students and parents\" that \"could have been much, much worse.\"\nSome of the students, shaken and tearful, spoke to local news stations. Most declined to give their full names. One student, speaking to Fox6 News, said she had been in the library when others came in and said there was a gun on campus. \n\"Then we heard there was a lockdown drill and we went to the corner,\" she said, adding that they had been told to take cover in places where there were no windows.

Investigators collected shell casings but would not provide a description of the gun or guns, the caliber or the number of weapons used. A police spokesman could not be reached on Monday.\nThe police said they had not ruled out the possibility that the shooting was gang-related. The school, Searles Elementary School, is nearly 10 blocks from the site where two men were shot on Nov. 20. The men had parked their vehicle when another car pulled up alongside and opened fire, the police said last week in a report about the incident. The men survived.\n\"Although there is no evidence to show that these two incidents are linked, investigators have not ruled out that possibility,\" the police statement said. \nThe Police Department would not release the names of the boys, and it was not clear what they were doing in a school parking lot in the early hours of a Saturday. \nA video provided by a neighbor showed more than half a dozen flashes as a weapon was fired at the van as it tried to drive away. The video was published in East Bay Times.\nJohn Thompson, the superintendent of the New Haven Unified School District, which includes Searles Elementary, said in a statement that the boys had been \"in or near\" the school around 1:26 a.m. on Saturday.

He said it was most likely a \"crime of opportunity\" that unfolded in a similar way to the previous shooting of the two men.\nOn Sunday, neighbors, family members and City Council members gathered at a makeshift memorial of flowers and candles near the parking lot.

It was named after the Midway Atoll, a strategic ring-shaped reef some 1,300 miles northwest of Honolulu, and was seen as a turning point for the United States in the Pacific campaign against Japan, which had naval superiority but lost four carriers in the episode.\n\nThe Petrel crew had spent weeks surveying the area, documenting more than 500 square nautical miles before picking up the wreckage in a conservation site known as Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument in the atoll region of the Central Pacific. Using sonar images, the Kaga came into view on Wednesday, and the Akagi was detected on Sunday in depths of 17,000 feet, according to Vulcan Inc., which owns and operates the Petrel and has served as the multibillionaire Paul G. Allen's organization overseeing and supporting his philanthropic initiatives. The carriers were the largest Japanese carriers that Japan had at the time.\nThe crew has discovered more than 30 sunken warships, including, this year, the remains of the American aircraft carrier Wasp, which was sunk by a Japanese submarine in July 1942, and, in 2015, the Japanese warship Musashi.\n\"This project is significantly different from previous missions as it required a level of investigation, analysis and survey of a carrier-based engagement initially separated by over 150 nautical miles,\" Robert Kraft, director of subsea operations for Vulcan, said in a statement. \"It was a major carrier-to-carrier battle that left its eerie evidence strewn for a total area covering thousands of square nautical miles across the ocean floor.\"\nPetrel owes its existence to Mr. Allen, who founded Microsoft with Bill Gates, and to Vulcan. Underwater exploration and World War II history were interests of Mr. Allen's. He died in 2018 at 65 after a recurrence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\nDuring the Battle of Midway, from June 3 to 7, the two carriers were dive-bombed by American planes and Kaga was torpedoed before they were scuttled by their own navies. The battle's overall casualty toll was 2,204 Japanese forces, and 307 American forces, according to Naval History and Heritage Command figures. \nThe scene as the two carriers went to their underwater graves was captured in a New York Times dispatch on June 10, 1942:\nAn Associated Press reporter onboard the Petrel who is writing about the discovery said that the Akagi was resting amid a pile of debris and that the ground around it was clearly disturbed by the impact of it hitting the seafloor. \n\"She's sitting upright on her keel, we can see the bow, we can see the stern clearly, you can see some of the gun emplacements on there, you can see that some of the flight deck is also torn up and missing so you can actually look right into where the flight deck would be,\" Mr. Kraft told the A.P.\nIn the battle, the United States lost one carrier, the Yorktown, and a destroyer, Hammann, while two other Japanese carriers, the Soryu and Hiryu, also sank.\n\"With each piece of debris and each ship we discover and identify, our intent is to honor history and those who served and paid the ultimate sacrifice for their countries,\" Mr. Kraft said.\nSimilar to previous discoveries, there are no plans to disturb the carriers, which are considered war graves that will go untouched, a Vulcan spokeswoman confirmed.\nFrank Thompson, a historian from the Naval History and Heritage Command, who is part of the team aboard the Petrel, said the discovery would give historians a \"new perspective\" of the pivotal battle. \"Unlike land battles, war at sea leaves no traces on the surface,\" he said in the statement."}, {"idx": 34, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/us/mattis-trump.html", "text": "Jim Mattis, the former defense secretary, departed from his usual reticence about President Trump and mocked his former boss in a speech on Thursday night that made fun of his bone spur diagnosis during the Vietnam War and his love for fast food.\nThe president had recently referred to Mr. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, as \"the world's most overrated general.\" Mr. Mattis picked up the reference and ran with it for several minutes after being introduced as the keynote speaker at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, an annual charity event in New York where politicians and other leaders typically roast one another. \n\"I'm not just an overrated general,\" Mr. Mattis said. \"I'm the greatest, the world's most overrated,\" he said, to laughter and applause.\nTurning to address Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, Mr. Mattis said he \"owed\" thanks to New York and to Mr. Schumer for bringing up the general's name during the \"contentious\" meeting where Mr. Trump called him \"overrated.\"\nIn that meeting at the White House on Wednesday, attended by congressional leaders of both parties, Mr. Trump denigrated Mr. Mattis's approach to combating terrorism in the Middle East. The general resigned last year as secretary of defense in protest of the president's decision to pull American troops out of Syria. \nMr. Mattis was \"the world's most overrated general,\" Mr. Trump told the group. \"You know why? He wasn't tough enough. I captured ISIS. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month.\"\nMr. Mattis said during the speech on Thursday, \"I'm honored to be considered that by Donald Trump, because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress.\" \n\"So I guess I'm the Meryl Streep of generals,\" he said. \"And frankly, that sounds pretty good to me.\"\n\"And you do have to admit that between me and Meryl, at least we have had some victories,\" he added.\nMr. Mattis went on, saying that people had asked him during the reception before the dinner whether the \"overrated\" description had bothered him.\n\"Of course not,\" he said in his speech. \"I have earned my spurs on the battlefield.\" \nHe added: \"Donald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor.\"\nThe annual dinner is traditionally a Friars Club-style roast where prominent figures take jabs at one another in a white-tie setting where tickets cost more than $1,000.\nMr. Mattis also referred to earlier remarks by the actor Martin Short, who was the master of ceremonies at the dinner, setting up a punch line. \n\"The only person in the military Mr. Trump does not feel is overrated,\" Mr. Mattis said. \"That's Colonel Sanders,\" the founder and symbol of Kentucky Fried Chicken. \nAlthough Mr. Mattis's remarks were made in a lighthearted setting, they were a departure from his apparent reluctance to comment on the president's actions.\nMany noted the contrast between Mr. Mattis's comedic delivery and the sober questions raised by another high-profile retired commander, Adm. William H. McRaven, who wrote an opinion piece for The New York Times that was published the same day.\nIf Mr. Trump \" doesn't demonstrate the leadership that America needs, both domestically and abroad, then it is time for a new person in the Oval Office \u2014 Republican, Democrat or independent \u2014 the sooner, the better,\" wrote Admiral McRaven, the man who oversaw the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011. \"The fate of our Republic depends upon it.\"\nBefore he resigned in December, Mr. Mattis told friends and aides repeatedly that he viewed his responsibility to protect the United States' 1.3 million active-duty troops as worth the concessions necessary as defense secretary to a mercurial president, The New York Times reported at the time. \n\"My views on treating allies with respect and also being cleareyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held,\" Mr. Mattis wrote in his resignation letter. \"Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.\"\nMr. Mattis devoted much of his Thursday speech, which lasted for nearly 17 minutes, to describing political mistrust in the country, the debt owed to those who have fought for liberty \u2014 \"among them the American men and women supporting our Kurdish allies\" \u2014 and the work it takes to maintain a democracy.\n\"Meanwhile, the roster of urgent national issues have continued to grow,\" he said. \"Unaddressed, and given the paralysis, impossible to address, and all of this was approaching a level of crisis even before the specter of impeachment arose.\" \n\"This is the moment for an act of remembrance,\" he said. \"Remembrance of the core principles we used to know and live by, and that we now seem to have forgotten.\""}], "Timothy Williams": [{"idx": 17, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/us/abortion-bills-ohio-ectopic-pregnancy.html", "text": "Months after state lawmakers around the country approved some of the most restrictive limits on abortion seen in decades, some states want to push still further. \nLeading the way is Ohio, where Republicans are contemplating banning nearly all abortions from the time of conception, with no exceptions for rape or incest, and the highly unusual step of allowing women who have abortions to be prosecuted for murder.\nEspecially contentious in the Ohio proposal is a provision that would direct doctors treating women with a sometimes life-threatening condition when a fertilized egg implants outside of the uterus to try to \"reimplant an ectopic pregnancy into the woman's uterus.\"\nAfter last spring's wave of state-led campaigns to limit abortions, a second surge is expected in early 2020 as legislators in Republican-dominated states begin new lawmaking sessions. Tennessee, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina and Idaho could all quickly approve bills next year that would in effect ban abortion. With a presidential election looming, the issue will be used by Democrats and Republicans alike to raise campaign funds and to spur election turnout.\nYet the tactics employed by some states have also opened an unexpected rift among abortion opponents over whether the new laws will actually harm efforts to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion.\nConservative lawmakers and their allies who want the toughest abortion limits say they no longer have patience for incremental restrictions tailored to reach the Supreme Court. \n\"The time for regulating evil and compromise is over,\" Candice Keller, a Republican in Ohio's House of Representatives and a sponsor of the new bill there, said in a statement. \"The time has come to abolish abortion in its entirety and recognize that each individual has the inviolable and inalienable right to life.\"\nAbortion rights advocates said they viewed the new bills as alarming attempts to curtail abortion access. \"Politicians are taking a hatchet to the rights and freedoms of the very people they're supposed to represent,\" said Alexis McGill Johnson, acting president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. \"Newly introduced legislation from states like Ohio is dangerous, and part of an aggressive effort that seeks to punish, investigate, and track people for accessing basic health care.\"\nIn fact, some longstanding anti-abortion groups say they believe that the Supreme Court is more likely to take up cases involving laws that seek tempered changes in abortion access, not outright bans that directly challenge Roe.\nThe increasingly restrictive legislation \"makes us look foolish,\" James Bopp, general counsel for the National Right to Life, an anti-abortion organization, said at a recent legislative hearing in Tennessee about a bill that would essentially ban abortion in that state. He said the new tide of legislation \u2014 though aimed at forcing a reconsideration of abortion by a remade Supreme Court \u2014 is unlikely either to pass legal muster at lower court levels or to be heard in the nation's highest court. \nBut early this year, after Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, a conservative jurist, joined the Supreme Court, Republican state legislators began to rush through measures that upended years of anti-abortion strategy.\nThe new attempts by states to curtail abortion come even as the strict limits passed this year in Alabama, Kentucky and Georgia have, at least temporarily, been blocked by federal and state courts.\nThose measures were intentionally in conflict with Roe, and conservative activists who backed them said the goal was to force the Supreme Court to re-evaluate \u2014 and ultimately overturn \u2014 the monumental decision. \nMainstream anti-abortion groups did not publicly object to the approach, and in some cases backed the measures. But that support has shifted in recent months as restrictive abortion bills made their way through legislatures.\n\"Some sponsors of these bills may be motivated by the belief that they present an 'ideal test case' for the Supreme Court,\" Clarke D. Forsythe, counsel at Americans United for Life, wrote in an analysis of the laws. \"Others think that an abortion prohibition will 'force' the Court to readdress Roe v. Wade. Neither of these assumptions is accurate. In fact, a prohibition on early abortions may be the type of law least likely to attract Supreme Court review.\" \nOrganizations that favor abortion rights, which have had their own setbacks and struggles, say the infighting among anti-abortion proponents has been surprisingly public.\n\"The divide is much more of an issue in 2019 than we have seen in decades,\" said Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. \"The 'go slow' approach wants to ban abortion as well,\" she said, adding, \"they just think it is more advantageous to pass restriction after restriction.\"\nSome states, including Ohio, have already passed so many incremental limits to abortion, Ms. Nash said, that there is little left to do aside from directly banning abortion. \"The states that have pursued the restrictions strategy have essentially walked themselves into an abortion ban,\" she said.\nIn Tennessee, a fight among anti-abortion groups about how far to go with legislation has long been brewing.\nTennessee Right to Life, one of the state's most prominent anti-abortion groups, has formed a coalition with Randy McNally, the state's Republican lieutenant governor, and the state's Catholic bishops in opposing the most restrictive of the state's recent abortion proposals, including a measure that would in effect ban abortion except if the woman's health was at significant risk.\nBut Janice Bowling, a Republican state senator, said that slower-moving strategies had failed and that clearer, firmer measures were needed. \"The current approach we are taking \u2014 a lot of infants are going to die and a lot of people are getting impatient,\" said Ms. Bowling, one of the sponsors of the bill.\nIn South Carolina, conservative and moderate Republicans have spent months arguing about strategy. Now lawmakers are considering a bill that would prohibit abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant.\nBut it is Ohio's measure, introduced in November, that has drawn the most attention for its sweeping limits to abortion.\nThe bill has been co-sponsored by 19 members of the state's 99-member House of Representatives and must also pass the State Senate, which is similarly dominated by Republicans. Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, has not taken a public position but has spoken frequently about his opposition to abortion.\nThe bill, which could be debated as early as January, has much in common with the legislation Alabama approved last spring. That bill had been regarded as the most restrictive abortion legislation in decades, and it has since been enjoined by a federal court.\nThe Ohio measure, which is 723 pages long, states that doctors must take \"all possible steps to preserve the life of the unborn child, while preserving the life of the woman. Such steps include, if applicable, attempting to reimplant an ectopic pregnancy into the woman's uterus.\"\nSome doctors have dismissed as \"science fiction\" the medical feasibility of such steps.\n\"We have no evidence that an ectopic pregnancy may be transplanted into the uterus and continue to develop normally,\" said Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, San Francisco. \"The process of implantation is complex \u2014 it's not just like a plant. It's not yet possible to disrupt an implanted pregnancy and transplant it from one location to another.\"\nDr. Grossman said that it was reasonable to conduct more research on the matter, but that it was \"completely unreasonable to advocate for this unproven treatment on humans.\"\nDoctors say ectopic pregnancies, which can cause a woman's fallopian tube to burst open, often lead to life-threatening bleeding.\nOhio Right to Life, the state's prominent anti-abortion organization, said it had not been involved in writing the legislation and was not ready to take a position on the measure. Generally, the group has supported an incremental approach to overturning Roe.\n\"We learned of it the same time everyone else did,\" Mike Gonidakis, president of Ohio Right to Life, said of the legislation. \"Being over 700 pages long, we are going through the entire legislation presently.\"\nMr. Gonidakis said he was lobbying for several other abortion limits that Ohio lawmakers were considering, including legislation that would require doctors who provide medical abortions to tell pregnant women that abortion drugs can be reversed.

This interview with her has been edited and condensed.\nHow did this happen?\nUnfortunately, we had three black boys in 1983 who were convicted and condemned to spend the rest of their lives in prison based on the now-recanted testimony of teenage witnesses who were 13, 14, 15 and 16 years old. They were questioned without the presence of their parents or legal counsel and pressured to identify the three individuals that were ultimately convicted. They were pressured by the Baltimore Police Department, as well as the prosecutor. The prosecutor in the case told a straight-up lie about exculpatory evidence he had. I also think it's really important not to ignore the race element. They were literally vilified in the entire community. They were treated like animals. We're able to dehumanize individuals that we see to be criminals.\nWhy did you start a team to look at cases like this?\nThe mission of a prosecutor is not to just go after individuals who have committed crimes and zealously advocate on behalf of victims and witnesses of crime. Your mission is justice over conviction.\nWhat sort of reaction have you gotten from other prosecutors?\nWhen we were trying last year to get approval in the State Legislature for the authority to move forward with these kinds of claims of actual innocence, a group of attorneys from around the state opposed it. They said that it was not the duty of prosecutors to right the wrongs of the past. And I said, \"Actually, according to the American Bar Association standards, that is exactly our duty.\" But, I mean, that's not the overall sentiment that we received. I think people understand that these are not individuals who have committed a crime. These are innocent individuals who have been wronged due to the misconduct of police and prosecutors by a system that was put into place to protect them. But in the end, it was the system that ultimately stole 36 years of their life. \nHow many flawed cases are there?\nI wouldn't be surprised if there were hundreds of the same kind of people sitting in prison right now. I would not be surprised when you look at some of the past practices. It's scary. But that's the point of having a unit that's dedicated to reinvestigating these types of claims. You know, I would say 10, 15, 20, 25 years ago, what prosecutors were focusing on were getting convictions. That was the measure of success.\nYou visited the three men in prison before they got out. Why?\nI wanted to be able to look them in the eyes, understanding that I now represent the system that wronged them. I was 3 years old when this happened. And I now have an obligation to acknowledge the part of the criminal justice system that has harmed them. I felt it was important to go to them \u2014 not to have them wait for me to make that apology, but to go to them, where the state, ultimately, put them. And to say, I'm sorry, on behalf of a system that can be as flawed as to take away 36 years of an innocent man's life."}, {"idx": 19, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/25/us/baltimore-men-exonerated-murder.html", "text": "The three teenagers were arrested on Thanksgiving Day, 1983, and deemed the perpetrators of a brazen crime: They had shot and killed a 14-year-old boy as he walked down the hallway of his junior high school to lunch. They wanted the boy's jacket, a popular Georgetown Starter style, the authorities said, and that motive \u2014 chilling and petty \u2014 drew outrage in Baltimore, where a jury soon convicted the teenagers of murder and sent them away for life. \nThirty-six years later, prosecutors announced that the convictions had been in error. Another teenager, the prosecutors now acknowledge, had been the real killer.\nOn Monday, three men \u2014 now graying and in their 50s \u2014 walked out of prison, freed after spending all of their adult lives behind bars. Alfred Chestnut, Ransom Watkins and Andrew Stewart appeared relieved but also perplexed as they emerged to tell a cluster of waiting news cameras about their years in prison, waging what often seemed like a hopeless fight to prove their innocence in the long-ago murder that they had always insisted they did not commit. \n\"I've been always dreaming of this,\" said Mr. Chestnut, who was flanked by his mother and his fianc\u00e9e. \"All my friends in prison know that I've always been talking about this, dreaming about this all of the time. Even when I was a kid, you know? 'Why is this happening to me?'\"\nAs part of a series of recent examinations of old, questionable cases, a unit of the Baltimore prosecutor's office found numerous errors in the investigation of the school shooting case. The new review concluded that a different student, now deceased, actually shot DeWitt Duckett, the junior high school student who was killed as he walked through Harlem Park Junior High School in Baltimore. \nOn Monday, Charles Peters, a Baltimore circuit court judge, accepted the state's attorney's request to exonerate the three men.\n\"My heart breaks for all three of these men, who must now reconcile that we live in a world that could take 36 years away from innocent men,\" said Marilyn Mosby, the state's attorney, who took over the prosecutor's office in 2015, decades after the original trial. \"Today isn't a victory. Today it's a tragedy that these men had 36 years of their lives stolen.\"\nAround the country, it has become increasingly common for prosecutors' offices to assign investigators to re-examine convictions when evidence suggests an error might have been made. \nFrom San Francisco to Brooklyn, prosecutors now have teams of specialized investigators who sift through old evidence. Dozens of people have been freed every year because of findings of significant errors or evidence of police or prosecutorial misconduct. In Baltimore, Ms. Mosby's office has cleared six other people of serious crimes since she took over.\nThe case of the three men released on Monday stood out for the length of time the men had served, and the ages at which they had been sent to prison: They spent more than twice as long behind bars as they had growing up at home. They had all along insisted that they were innocent, and they told people that every chance they got. Even when they had chances of parole, years into their sentences, they had been unable to get it because they were unwilling to admit to the killing. \n\n\nMs. Mosby's office said that the case against the three men was  plagued with misconduct, including lies told by Jonathan Shoup, the state's attorney at the time, that unfairly tipped the case in prosecutors' favor. Mr. Shoup died in 2016.\nThe three men, who were then 16-year-old high school students, had ditched classes on Nov. 18, 1983, and had been at the junior high visiting friends until a security guard kicked them off campus.\nAbout 30 minutes later, DeWitt, the junior high student, was walking to lunch with friends when someone demanded his jacket. After a struggle, he was shot with a .22-caliber handgun in the neck and collapsed. He died two hours later.\nThe school shooting drew close attention at the time, and police officers had been under immense pressure to swiftly solve the case, prosecutors said. \nAmong failings of the earlier investigation, Ms. Mosby's office said, were denials by Mr. Shoup that his office possessed evidence that might cast doubt on the guilt of the three. Yet multiple witnesses at the time, Ms. Mosby's office said, had actually identified a different person, Michael Willis, then 18, as the gunman. \nMr. Willis died in a shooting in 2002. \nThe new evidence was only revealed after Mr. Chestnut, now 52, submitted a public records request in 2018 and was eventually granted access to the court file that had been sealed by the trial judge. \nThe file also showed that four juvenile witnesses, who told the court that Mr. Chestnut and the others had been involved in the shooting, had actually failed multiple times to identify them in photo arrays before the trial.\nThe witnesses, who were junior high school students, have since recanted, according to the court documents.

The charges \u2014 wire fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to defraud the government and two counts of tax evasion \u2014 carry a maximum penalty of 35 years in prison. \nA federal grand jury indicted Ms. Pugh after the F.B.I. investigated a scheme in which a series of children's books she wrote, known as \"Healthy Holly\" books with titles like \"Exercising Is Fun\" and \"Vegetables Are Not Just Green,\" was used to defraud health care companies, Baltimore's school system and taxpayers. \nStarting when Ms. Pugh was a member of the Maryland Legislature in 2011, she sold tens of thousands of copies of the self-published \"Healthy Holly\" series to health care companies and charitable organizations with the promise that the books would be donated to schoolchildren.\nIn some cases, the indictment said, Ms. Pugh sold copies of the same set of books to two different buyers, enabling her to be paid twice.\nFrequently, federal prosecutors said, Ms. Pugh failed to deliver the books. Instead, they said, she kept both the books and the money used to buy them. Eventually, thousands of copies of books were found in a Baltimore City Public School System warehouse; others were kept in Ms. Pugh's offices and in one of her houses.\nAt other times, Ms. Pugh did not have the books printed at all, but still kept the money used to buy them.\nThe arrangement generated more than $600,000 for the mayor, officials said, much of it from companies that had business ties to city government. Ms. Pugh used the money to buy a second home in Baltimore and to fund her political campaigns, the prosecutors said.\nTwo others, including Gary Brown Jr., who served as an aide to Ms. Pugh in the State Senate and at City Hall, have pleaded guilty in connection to the case.\nMs. Pugh's legal problems come as Baltimore continues to struggle with one of the nation's highest rates of violent crime. Nearly one in four residents live in poverty.\nShe took office in 2016, as the city struggled to emerge from the turmoil following the death in police custody of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old African-American man.\nA former state senator and majority leader in Maryland's General Assembly, Ms. Pugh pledged to heal the city's wounds and to lead with honor.\n\"We will rebuild trust between police officers and the community, taking care of our officers and our people, and confront the root causes of crime,\" Ms. Pugh promised in a mission statement she issued. \"The city needs a leader who will serve with honesty, integrity and transparency. That's who I am, and this is the job for me.\"\nAfter the hearing on Thursday, Robert K. Hur, the United States attorney for Maryland, described Ms. Pugh's tenure in blistering terms. \"She betrayed the trust placed in her by the public,\" he said. \"We need dedication and professionalism in our leaders, not fraud and corruption.\"\nMs. Pugh's lawyers declined to comment, and Ms. Pugh left the courthouse and got into a waiting vehicle."}, {"idx": 21, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/28/us/jarrod-ramos-guilty-capital-gazette.html", "text": "A man charged with killing five people in a Maryland newsroom last year changed his plea to guilty on Monday but will still pursue an insanity defense that argues he should not be held criminally responsible, the authorities said. \nThe man, Jarrod W. Ramos, had previously pleaded not guilty on 23 charges, including five counts of first-degree murder, after what is considered the deadliest attack against journalists in the United States. A circuit court judge in Maryland, Laura Ripken, accepted Mr. Ramos's plea and found him guilty after a lengthy hearing on Monday.\nEditors, reporters and a sales assistant were killed in the June 2018 shooting at The Capital, a daily newspaper in Annapolis, Md. Mr. Ramos had a long history of conflict with the Capital Gazette, the community newspaper chain that publishes The Capital. \nA trial to determine whether he is criminally responsible is expected to start Nov. 4. If Mr. Ramos is found not to be criminally responsible, he could be sent to a state psychiatric facility instead of prison.\nProsecutors said they had assembled overwhelming evidence proving that Mr. Ramos had carried out the attack. In court filings, prosecutors said they planned to show the jury surveillance videotape of the shooting, in which a gunman is seen firing shotgun blasts through the newspaper office's glass doors and then continuing to fire once inside.\nAnne Colt Leitess, the Anne Arundel County state's attorney, told the court on Monday that Mr. Ramos had barricaded shut the back door of the newsroom and an insurance business across the hall before opening fire.\nWendi Winters, a reporter at the newspaper, tried to stop Mr. Ramos by wielding a recycling bin, prosecutors said. Ms. Winters, 65, was killed in the attack.\nOnce the authorities got inside the building, Ms. Leitess said, police officers found Mr. Ramos under a desk, hiding silently. Prosecutors said an officer's body-worn video camera recorded Mr. Ramos saying: \"I surrender. I surrender. I'm your shooter.\"\nWhen the authorities first asked Mr. Ramos his name, Ms. Leitess said, he responded, \"You don't know my name?\" Mr. Ramos then told them to talk to the leaders of the newspaper. \nMr. Ramos had filed a defamation lawsuit against Capital Gazette Communications and several of its employees in July 2012, about a year after it published an article about his guilty plea in a previous harassment case. In that case, he was sentenced to 18 months of supervised probation and ordered to attend counseling.\nA judge dismissed the lawsuit when Mr. Ramos could not identify anything that had been falsely reported or that he had been harmed by the article.

The job, she said, is the most stable work she has had and helped put her son through college.\nShe has grown tired of people's moral qualms about what she does for a living, of police harassment, and of the dangers of the work. But she is doing more than stewing about it.\nInstead, Ms. Spellman is one of the architects of a bill before the District of Columbia Council that would make it the first American city to decriminalize prostitution, placing the nation's capital at the forefront of a growing movement that seeks to permit the activities of prostitutes, as well as pimps and johns, and to allow bordellos. Prostitution in the United States is legal only in a few counties in Nevada, which has about 20 legal brothels.\nAt an initial hearing on Thursday, more than 150 people \u2014 many of them current and former sex workers \u2014 gave radically different opinions about whether decriminalization would cause prostitutes greater harm. Some wore T-shirts that said, \"Sex workers deserve housing, not handcuffs.\" \nThe proposal is dividing the city's progressive community, pitting some women's groups against advocates for sex workers. Some prostitutes who have been sex trafficked find themselves on the other side from sex workers who have not been. But all sides agree that prostitution practiced openly would reverberate well beyond the city's thriving but shadowy sex industry of street prostitution, massage parlors, strip clubs and high-end call girls. \nProstitutes would most likely work openly out of homes in neighborhoods across the city. Certain blocks could become de facto red-light districts. And policing strategy would have to change so officers could distinguish pimps from sex traffickers. \nMs. Spellman, a transgender woman and activist, has worked for more than two years with Councilman David Grosso and advocacy groups in the city to try to marshal support for the legislation.\nViolence against sex workers had made it critical for lawmakers to do something radical to try to protect them, Mr. Grosso said at Thursday's hearing. \"The criminalization approach has failed,\" he said. \nBut Sarah Smith, 21, who said she had been trafficked as an 18-year-old, said normalizing prostitution would make it far more difficult for the police to find people being exploited. \"This bill will make it nearly impossible for victims like me to get justice,\" she said.\nFour of the Council's 13 members have signed on as co-sponsors. Supporters say the bill \u2014 versions of which have recently made little headway in New York State, San Francisco, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and elsewhere \u2014 is the only effective way to combat sex trafficking. They say that only when every aspect of prostitution among consenting adults is made legal will prostitutes feel secure enough to report criminal activity, including coercion and abuse by pimps or sex buyers, without fear of arrest.\n\"It is an outdated law based on moral outrage,\" Ms. Spellman, 52, a longtime advocate for sex workers, said about existing prohibitions on prostitution. \"Why are they arresting people for having casual sex? I understand the need to protect people, and there are people being exploited, but not in the numbers that people think.\"\nCritics counter that the initiative is promoting a narrative that is dangerously false. They say decriminalization would exacerbate the sex trade's worst abuses because it would increase demand for prostitution. That, they say, would force ever younger girls into prostitution and make it difficult for law enforcement to detect sex trafficking cases because citizens might call 911 less frequently if prostitution is legal.\nOpponents have also spoken darkly about the nation's capital becoming a destination for sex tourism.\n\"This bill is a sex trafficker's dream,\" said Yasmin Vafa, executive director of Rights4Girls, a Washington-based human rights organization that seeks to end violence against girls and young women. \"This will cause more harm and more exploitation of our most marginalized people. Girls have told us they heard about the bill for the first time from their pimps, who were excited about it. If pimps and sex buyers are on the same side of this legislative proposal, doesn't that say something to the other supporters?\"\nGroups supporting decriminalization include the A.C.L.U., Black Lives Matter, Amnesty International and the World Health Organization.\nOpponents include the National Organization for Women and World Without Exploitation, a coalition of groups dedicated to ending sexual trafficking and exploitation.\nThe two sides speak about prostitution in very different terms.\nFor supporters, sex work for adults can be a viable, well-compensated profession that is generally free of exploitation. Pimps are referred to as managers, and violence is uncommon. They argue that laws forbidding bordellos mean that prostitutes are unable to have consensual sex with clients in the safety of their own homes.\nMs. Spellman, who says she does not have a pimp and handles her own business affairs, said pimps and managers serve a vital role \u2014 from providing security and transportation to arranging appointments and dealing with child care.\n\"If the issue people have about pimps is that they are benefiting from other people's labor, don't they have managers who do that at McDonald's?\" she asked.\nFor opponents, however, prostitution cannot be separated from exploitation. \n\"This is an incredibly violent industry and a harmful industry,\" said Lauren Hersh, national director of World Without Exploitation.\nMany of the organizations that oppose decriminalizing pimps and johns support variations of what is known as the Nordic model, in which sex workers do not face criminal charges, and are instead offered social services, including housing.\nTina Frundt, a sex trafficking survivor and executive director of Courtney's House in Washington, which provides services to children and young adults who have been trafficked, said 30 percent of the people who come to the center had been trafficked by relatives. Most are between 11 and 19 years old.\n\"I do not believe sex workers should be arrested \u2014 that's a no-brainer,\" she said. \"But this bill legalizes pimping. This bill is horrible.\"\nIn many ways, the disagreement is a sign of how quickly the decriminalization movement has become mainstream, an unexpected outgrowth of successful efforts during the past decade to call attention to racial disparities in mass incarceration and the mistreatment of women as part of the #MeToo movement. Prostitutes in many American cities are disproportionately African-American, Native American and Latina women and transgender people, advocates say.\nThe murders of transgender women in recent years, some of whom were sex workers, have also fueled the movement. Advocates believe that decriminalizing sex work would specifically help protect transgender people because they often face discrimination when seeking jobs and decent housing.\nSeveral cities have curtailed their arrests for prostitution in recent years, although buying sex is still prosecuted and pimping continues to be treated as a serious crime. Law enforcement officials say pimps are often also sex traffickers who force women and girls into prostitution through intimidation and violence, including kidnapping. Street gangs have increasingly become involved in organizing prostitution networks.\nThe experience of New Zealand, which decriminalized prostitution in 2003, is used by both sides to try to bolster their position.\nDecriminalization advocates point to a 2012 study that found that \"the vast majority of people involved in the sex industry are better off\" in New Zealand, while opponents call attention to the National Council of Women of New Zealand's finding that some prostitutes continue to be as young as 13.\nIn Washington on an overcast autumn day this week, motorists could be observed pulling over and engaging in brief conversations with women who lingered on a sidewalk along a stretch of K Street, a few miles from the White House. The women would sometimes climb inside the vehicles and the driver would merge back into traffic.\nThe sex industry has grown as the city has gentrified, according to prostitutes and the police. There have been numerous arrests on 14th Street and K Street in recent months, and prostitution in the K Street area has led to an F.B.I. investigation into sex trafficking.\nIn 2017, the police in Washington made 216 prostitution-related arrests, which includes crimes committed by prostitutes and pimps, according to police data. That figure increased to 519 in 2018, and there have already been nearly 800 prostitution-related arrests this year. The increase probably reflects changes in both police enforcement and in the prostitution market. \nThe K Street corridor is an illustration of why the legislation is needed, said Tiara Moten, an organizer with No Justice No Pride, a Washington-based group that works with the L.G.B.T. community.\n\"Decriminalizing sex work will make life easier not only for the people that complain about K Street, but also for the girls who are getting turned away from jobs, housing, health care and more,\" she said. \"Everyone needs to survive, and everyone needs to make money.\"\nIn addition to decriminalizing the entire sex industry, the legislation calls for the creation of a task force to study the law's potential impact and then decide what changes might be necessary.\nDespite the dire warnings of advocates about sex trafficking, Ms. Spellman said decriminalization cannot come soon enough for her and other transgender sex workers.\n\"People who have not walked in my shoes are telling me what's best for me,\" she said. People look at legalizing prostitution and see something nefarious, she said. \"But what we've asked for is exactly what we need.\""}, {"idx": 23, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/us/fbi-crime-data.html", "text": "Violent crime in the United States, including murders, declined in 2018 for a second consecutive year, according to F.B.I. data released on Monday.

Berke, a New York-based white-collar defense lawyer, has served as the special oversight counsel to the committee since February, working to build the investigative framework that now appears destined to end in the impeachment of Mr. Trump. On Monday, he will take a rare turn at the witness table to present for 30 minutes the facts before the committee and how they square with the law.\nMr. Berke will not be the only House lawyer publicly presenting on Monday. Daniel S. Goldman of the Intelligence Committee will orally present his panel's two-month inquiry concluding that Mr. Trump abused his office to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. Stephen R. Castor will represent Republicans on both the judiciary and intelligence panels.\nBut Mr. Berke will be the first witness to speak, setting the tone for the proceeding and a week that could end with the Judiciary Committee voting to recommend impeachment articles.\nAlong with Norman L. Eisen, a former top Obama White House ethics lawyer, Mr. Berke has consulted with the committee since Democrats retook the majority this year to organize and carry out a sprawling investigation into possible abuse of power and obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump. He has helped draft subpoenas for testimony and records, questions for key hearings and, most recently, articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump. \nBefore they joined the committee, Mr. Berke and Mr. Eisen wrote a series of reports on obstruction of justice, collusion and Mr. Trump for the Brookings Institution.\nIn September, during his only other appearance before television cameras, Mr. Berke's cross-examination of Corey Lewandowski elicited an admission from Mr. Lewandowski that he had been dishonest in a television interview about his role in a scheme by Mr. Trump to curtail the Mueller investigation.\n\"I have no obligation not to be dishonest to the media because they are as dishonest as anybody else,\" Mr. Lewandowski said.\nRepublicans have bitterly complained about Mr. Berke and Mr. Eisen, arguing that the hiring of outside legal consultants constitutes the \"privatization of impeachment.\"\nA graduate of Duke and Harvard Law School, Mr. Berke worked for four years in the federal defender's office of the Southern District of New York. He joined Kramer Levin in New York in the 1990s and built a practice around complicated financial and tax crimes and a reputation as one of the leading cross-examiners in the country. He is on leave from the firm, taking the train to Washington each week.\nIn 2011, Mr. Berke's defense of a former Deutsche Bank broker accused of marketing fraudulent tax shelters set the New York legal world atwitter with the novel use of a simple prop: his red hankie. When he cross-examined the government's star witness, a tax lawyer involved in the scheme, Mr. Berke asked him to take part in some role play. When the handkerchief was in his pocket, the witness was to treat Mr. Berke like a potential client and give him the pitch the witness had given real-life clients about why the shelters worked.\nAfter four days of questioning, Mr. Berke successfully undermined the prosecution's case and his client was acquitted; four co-defendants not represented by Mr. Berke were convicted.\nPaul H. Schoeman, who worked with him on the case, said the flare of creativity was quintessential Mr. Berke.\n\"In New York legal circles, Barry's performance in that trial was a real event,\" Mr. Schoeman said. \"He is really creative and inventive in his thinking, and he combines that with incredible preparation and hard work. It's not just a good idea; it's well executed.\"\nMr. Berke has also been active in New York Democratic circles, and he is no stranger to high-profile political cases.

Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, countered that there should only be two.\nA vigorous debate unfolded, and in the end Ms. Pelosi made the call: There would be only two articles of impeachment, on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, narrowly focused on the investigation into Mr. Trump's pressure campaign on Ukraine. A third, on obstruction of justice tied to the president's attempts to thwart the inquiry of Robert S. Mueller III, the former special counsel, was too much of a reach.\nOn Tuesday, the Democrats unveiled those two articles, pushing forward with their carefully managed plans to impeach Mr. Trump before Christmas. But the last-minute dispute over how broad a case to bring reflects the competing demands on Democrats from within their own party, and their determination to appear as unified as possible in a hyper-polarized environment. \nNow, Democrats will see whether their decision has its intended effect of keeping the party united behind impeaching Mr. Trump, protecting moderate lawmakers who face steep re-election challenges in conservative-leaning districts, and persuading the public \u2014 and the Senate, where a trial will play out \u2014 of the seriousness of their case.\nMany of the moderates had resisted impeaching Mr. Trump for months, convinced that Mr. Mueller's report was not sufficient grounds to proceed, as public polling showed that voters did not see a clear case. Representative Max Rose, a freshman Democrat from a Staten Island swing district, for instance, told his constituents that it was better for the country to simply move on from the Russia episode than impeach Mr. Trump over it. He changed course and embraced the impeachment inquiry only after allegations surfaced that the president tried to pressure Ukraine to help him in the 2020 election. \nEven now, some centrist Democrats are worried about the process. A group of them met behind closed doors on Monday to discuss the possibility of opposing the articles of impeachment and instead trying to build bipartisan support for a resolution to formally censure the president. They quickly dismissed the idea, which seemed destined to fail. But their conversations reflected the eagerness of some Democrats to avoid the spectacle of a highly partisan impeachment of Mr. Trump in the House. \nThe debate that unfolded in Ms. Pelosi's personal office took place only hours after she announced to the nation on Thursday that she had directed her lieutenants to draft articles of impeachment. Sitting around a large wooden table already decorated for Christmas, the visage of Abraham Lincoln staring down from a portrait on the wall, she and the senior Democrats hashed out their disagreement. \nMr. Nadler, who had spent months trying to build an impeachment case from Mr. Mueller's findings, argued that it was not enough just to charge Mr. Trump with abusing his power and obstructing Congress. We should go broader, he asserted, laying out a pattern of behavior by Mr. Trump. What message would it send if the House gave Mr. Trump a pass for such egregious misconduct?\nThree of Mr. Nadler's fellow committee leaders in the room concurred: Eliot L. Engel of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Carolyn B. Maloney of the Oversight and Reform Committee, and Maxine Waters of the Financial Services Committee.\nBut Mr. Neal warned that if Democrats put forward anything but their strongest, most agreed-upon case, they risked repeating the mistakes Republicans made in 1998 when they proposed four articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton, only to see two defeated in votes that split their party.\nAnd Representative Adam B. Schiff, the influential Intelligence Committee chairman, said the facts his panel collected showing that Mr. Trump had solicited Ukraine's assistance in his re-election campaign carried special urgency, and should not get bogged down by a months-old fight.\nThe debate, described by lawmakers and aides familiar with its contours who insisted on anonymity, mirrored a larger argument running through the Democratic caucus in recent weeks as it became increasingly clear the House was destined to draw up formal charges against the 45th president.\nThe final decision, agreed to by all six committee leaders, came down to this: The vast majority of Democrats agree that the allegations of wrongdoing toward Ukraine are overwhelming and pressing as well as a continuing threat to the nation. The same could not be said of attempts by Mr. Trump to interfere with Mr. Mueller's work.\nPeople close to her said Ms. Pelosi always remained reluctant to move based on obstruction of justice. The case dealt with events in the past, failed to excite public opinion, and far from uniting her caucus, it made moderate freshman lawmakers who had delivered Democrats the majority deeply uncomfortable. \n\"You make choices and people have different opinions and at the end you come up with a recommendation,\" Mr. Engel said on Tuesday. \"When you come to consensus it doesn't mean that initially everybody had the same idea.\"\nEven after Thursday's meeting, though, some lawmakers and officials in favor of including an obstruction of justice article worked through the weekend to try to persuade their colleagues otherwise. The Judiciary Committee went as far as sketching out what a possible obstruction of justice charge might look like, according to one official familiar with its work.\nThe idea had powerful proponents. Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 House Democrat, told McClatchy in an interview last week that obstruction of justice belonged in the articles.\n\"Obstruction of justice, I think, is too clear not to include,\" he said. Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, agreed.\nSome lawmakers floated the idea that obstruction of justice and obstruction of Congress could be combined into a single article of impeachment claiming a broad-based pattern of conduct over more than two years. But that almost certainly would not have appealed to moderates.\nThey did manage to incorporate at least one key aspect of their argument in the final articles. Even without mentioning obstruction of justice, Democratic leaders included a paragraph in each tightly scripted article alluding to a pattern of behavior.\n\"These actions were consistent with President Trump's previous efforts to undermine United States government investigations into foreign interference in United States elections,\" they wrote in Article I. \nMr. Mueller dedicated a full volume of his lengthy report on Russia's interference in the 2016 election to Mr. Trump's attempts to undercut his inquiry. It included nearly a dozen episodes of possible obstruction of justice. Among them were his dismissal of James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, attempts to fire Mr. Mueller, efforts to pressure the attorney general at the time, Jeff Sessions, not to recuse himself from the inquiry and then to reverse that decision and retake control of the inquiry, issuing a misleading statement about a meeting with Russians and potentially trying to influence witness testimony.\nBut the report was far from clear cut. Mr. Mueller himself said he could not decide whether the conduct constituted illegal obstruction because of a Justice Department policy prohibiting the indictment of a sitting president. Attorney General William P. Barr showed no such reluctance, stepping in before the public ever saw Mr. Mueller's report to clear the president of wrongdoing.\nEven House Democrats were not convinced; for months, less than half of the lawmakers in their ranks supported impeaching Mr. Trump.\nMr. Rose was emblematic. He made himself freely available to reporters last week to remind them that he had not supported proceeding with an impeachment inquiry based on the Mueller report, but because he saw something more menacing in the Ukraine allegations.\nAnother vulnerable moderate, Representative Elaine Luria, Democrat of Virginia, said on Tuesday that she would probably support the articles as introduced. She helped remove any last opposition to an impeachment inquiry in September when she and six other freshman Democrats with national security backgrounds published an op-ed in The Washington Post saying the accusations of Mr. Trump were a threat to national security.\n\"I wanted to see that they would be narrow, that was my desire, so I am satisfied,\" Ms. Luria told reporters. \nPrivately, some progressives and members of the Judiciary Committee lamented that months of earlier work would go unused.\nRepresentative Lloyd Doggett, a liberal Democrat from Texas, conceded that as bad as Mr. Trump's attempts to impede Mr. Mueller were, there was too much murkiness around the special counsel's report to make it a clear case for impeachment.\n\"Going back to pick that up would just give Republicans more talking points and excuses to delay,\" he said. \nMr. Barr's pre-emptive statements clearing the president of any wrongdoing \"set the stage for some confusion out there about what was in the Mueller report,\" Mr. Doggett said. \"I'm not sure we ever fully recovered.\""}, {"idx": 26, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/us/politics/trump-impeachment-judiciary.html", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Judiciary Committee Democrats on Thursday abruptly put off a pair of historic impeachment votes after a drawn-out battle with Republicans stretched late into the night, setting up final action on Friday to approve charges that President Trump abused his power and obstructed Congress.\nRepresentative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, called off the votes moments before they were expected to take place, announcing just after 11 p.m. that he wanted lawmakers to have time to \"search their consciences\" before the final roll call.\nThe chairman said the committee would reconvene Friday at 10 a.m. to promptly finalize two articles of impeachment, with the outcome certain.\nBefore Mr. Nadler brought down his gavel on the session, Democrats had been poised to approve along party lines an article of impeachment that accused Mr. Trump of abusing the powers of his office by pressuring Ukraine to announce investigations of his political rivals.\nThey were also on track to adopt a second article of impeachment against Mr. Trump for obstructing Congress, based on an across-the-board defiance of their subpoenas that Democrats branded an attempt to conceal the Ukraine scheme.\nGathered in the Ways and Means Committee room for the second consecutive day, lawmakers had feuded over the two articles of impeachment all day, their tempers flaring and patience wearing thin as the 14-hour session wore on. \nThe Republicans were combative, and their amendments were rebuffed in one lopsided vote after another. Mr. Nadler's sudden move to delay the final votes provoked a final eruption of anger by Republicans, who complained of a last indignity in what they have argued was a wholly unfair and misguided impeachment proceeding. \nRepresentative Doug Collins of Georgia, the committee's top Republican, said he and his colleagues had been \"ambushed\" by the chairman after Republicans had agreed to close the debate Thursday night and lawmakers had scheduled flights for Friday morning.\n\"This is the most bush league stunt I have ever witnessed in my professional life,\" Mr. Collins said.\nBut Democrats did not want to give Republicans the ability to claim they had moved the articles of impeachment in the middle of the night when Americans were not watching.\n\"It has been a long two days of consideration of these articles and it is late at night,\" Mr. Nadler said. \"I want the members on both sides of the aisle to think about what has happened over these last two days and search their consciences before we cast our final votes.\"\nThe charges on the cusp of approval stemmed from an investigation by the House Intelligence Committee that concluded that Mr. Trump had used the levers of government to pressure Ukraine into investigating former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., his political rival, and a theory that Democrats conspired with Ukraine to interfere in the 2016 election. The president, Democrats asserted, conditioned nearly $400 million in security assistance for the former Soviet republic and a White House meeting for its leader on the public announcement of the investigations Mr. Trump wanted.\n\"Ample facts demonstrate that President Trump put his personal interests above the country, its citizens and the Constitution,\" said Mr. Nadler said earlier in the debate. \"This is the highest of constitutional crimes: abuse of power.\"\nHe added, \"So the president must be impeached to safeguard the security of our elections, to safeguard the separation of powers, both of which are essential to safeguard our liberties.\"\nThe Judiciary Committee vote now expected on Friday would make Mr. Trump, whose unorthodox and polarizing presidency has preoccupied the nation like few of his modern predecessors', only the fourth president in American history to face impeachment by the House for \"high crimes and misdemeanors.\" Though the charges allude to a pattern of past conduct, they do not explicitly mention his embrace of Russian election interference in 2016 or efforts to thwart a special counsel investigation of it.\nThe full House is expected to debate and vote on the articles next week, only days before Congress is scheduled to leave town for Christmas. A trial in the Republican-controlled Senate would begin in early 2020, 10 months before the next election.\nSenator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, dismissed the case against Mr. Trump as \"pretty weak stuff,\" predicting there was \"no chance\" it would garner the 67 votes needed for conviction in the Senate. In an interview with Fox News, Mr. McConnell appeared to put aside any notion of impartiality as a juror in the coming trial.\n\"There will be no difference between the president's position and our position in how to handle this,\" Mr. McConnell said.\nHis comments came hours after he had met in his Capitol office with Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, and Eric Ueland, the legislative affairs director, to strategize on the process.\nWhile the Judiciary Committee debated, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would refrain from pressing Democrats to support the articles, instead encouraging them to follow their consciences on a vote heavy with historic and political weight.\n\"People have to come to their own conclusions,\" she said. Republican leaders, however, began an all-out effort to keep their members in line to vote \"no.\"\nDemocratic leaders anticipate that a handful of their members \u2014 particularly more moderate lawmakers from districts Mr. Trump won in 2016 \u2014 may join Republicans in opposing one or both of the articles. But they expect the defections to be narrow.\nFar from expressing remorse for the charges against him, the president again declared his innocence and raged against the Democrats leading the charge to impeach him. He turned to Twitter, his favored social media platform, to retweet dozens of allies who were defending his conduct and slamming the Democrats. \nMr. Trump accused Ms. Pelosi of a two-and-half-year impeachment obsession. \n\"This was the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats plan all along, long before the Ukraine phone call,\" he wrote in a tweet. \"Impeachment Hoax!\"\nEarlier, as the debate grinded on through the night, a tuxedoed Mr. Trump hobnobbed with Republican lawmakers at the White House's congressional Christmas ball. \n\"We're going to have a fantastic year,\" he said.\nDetermined not to lend the proceedings legitimacy, Mr. Trump never mounted a defense in the House, declining repeated invitations from Democrats to take part in the process. He would be given a fairer chance in the Senate, the president and his team concluded. \nThe vote set for Friday would cap more than two days of intense debate in the Judiciary Committee, a body known for attracting some of the House's most progressive and conservative members. Lawmakers had stayed late into Wednesday night offering, one by one, statements of fact and principle about the presidency, the Constitution, the country and Mr. Trump himself. Members on both sides of the dais lamented that their opposites would not reconsider, though none of the pleaders really expected any change.\nThursday's proceeding was rawer, airing out all of the pent-up bitterness of years of near existential political warfare. Republicans argued that Democrats were merely impeaching the president because they abhorred his unorthodox style and his conservative policies, citing years' worth of strident cries from the most liberal members of their party championing Mr. Trump's removal.\n\"This impeachment is going to fail,\" said Representative Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana. \"The Democrats are going to pay a heavy political price for it, but the Pandora's box they have opened today will do irreparable injury to our country in years ahead.\"\nDemocrats accused Republicans of turning a blind eye to misconduct by Mr. Trump out of reflexive loyalty to their party. \n\"This is about conscience, the conscience of the nation, the conscience of my friends on the other side of the aisle,\" said Representative Hank Johnson, Democrat of Georgia. \"Do you believe that we should allow this to go unaddressed, what the president did? Because we are a country of precedent, we are a country of rule of law, we are a country of norms and traditions.\"\nThe debate traces back months, through a lengthy Intelligence Committee investigation, to the submission of an anonymous C.I.A. whistle-blower complaint alleging a systematic campaign by Mr. Trump to solicit Ukraine's help in the 2020 election, by asking its president to investigate his political rivals.\nUnlike past impeachment cases, there was no special prosecutor or independent counsel to look into the Ukraine matter. Beginning in late September, the House Intelligence Committee did so itself, calling more than a dozen American diplomats and administration officials to testify, first in private, then in public. Over the course of the fall, they confirmed and expanded on the facts in the whistle-blower's complaint, uncovering a broad scheme by Mr. Trump and allies inside and outside the government to supplant long-held American policy toward Ukraine in line with the president's personal political interests.\nThursday's debate touched on the finer points of criminal law and constitutional standards for impeachment as lawmakers dug into the details of the case, tussling over whether Trump's \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" actually met the threshold for his removal. Republicans said the president's actions needed to be statutory crimes to warrant impeachment, and accused Democrats of putting forth a vague charge of abuse of power because they had a flimsy factual record to back up their case. They did not concede any wrongdoing.\n\"The entire argument for impeachment in this case is based on a charge that is not a crime, much less a high crime, and that has never been approved by the House of Representatives in a presidential impeachment before, ever in history,\" said Representative Steve Chabot, Republican of Ohio and one of the managers of the impeachment case against President Bill Clinton in 1998. \"If that is the best you've got, you wasted a whole lot of time and taxpayer dollars because so many of you, Mr. Chairman, hate this president.\"\nDemocrats rejected that theory, arguing that Mr. Trump's actions were clearly high crimes because they were offenses against the Constitution itself, but could also be construed as criminal violations of the law. Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California, posited that Mr. Trump could be charged with criminal bribery and honest services fraud.\nIn seeking to clear Mr. Trump, Republicans returned again and again to statements by the president and Ukrainian leaders since the inquiry began that there was no pressure applied by Mr. Trump or felt in Kyiv. They pointed out that Ukraine did not announce the investigations Mr. Trump wanted and that the military aid the president had blocked for months was eventually released and a meeting between the presidents occurred.\n\"Show me the Ukrainian that was pressured,\" said Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida and a loquacious defender of Mr. Trump. \"Show me the Ukrainian that knew that any of this was tied to any conditionality.\"\nBut Democrats said that, too, was fallacious, noting that Mr. Trump allowed the aid to be delivered only after he had been briefed about the whistle-blower complaint. The security assistance funds were released \"because the president got caught,\" said Representative Val B. Demings, Democrat of Florida. She insisted that lawmakers ought not to be persuaded by the fact that Mr. Trump never explicitly said he was tying official acts to political favors.\n\"I can tell you this,\" said Ms. Demings, a former police chief, \"when a robber points a gun at you to take their money, they usually don't walk up and say, 'I'm robbing you.'\"\nDespite the seriousness of the proceedings, the debate took turns for the tawdry and personal. Around noon, Mr. Gaetz proposed an amendment highlighting unproven corruption allegations around Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son, and proceeded to read aloud from a news article graphically describing the younger Mr. Biden's history of substance abuse. Democrats shook their heads and one of them, Mr. Johnson of Georgia, offered a word of caution to Mr. Gaetz with a veiled reference to the Florida Republican's own past arrest on charges of driving under the influence.\n\"The pot calling the kettle black is not something we should do,\" Mr. Johnson said."}, {"idx": 27, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/09/us/politics/impeachment-trump.html", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Democrats signaled that they would unveil articles of impeachment on Tuesday morning that charge President Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for conduct they called a \"clear and present danger\" to the 2020 election and national security.\nThe House Judiciary Committee was expected to work through the night on Monday readying the charges, according to multiple senior officials and lawmakers.\nThey cautioned that plans were not final, but several officials said they were now focused on two charges: that Mr. Trump violated his oath of office by putting his political concerns over the national interest and that he stonewalled congressional attempts to investigate. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss the decision before it was ready.\n\"What happened with Ukraine \u2014 it's not something we can close our eyes to,\" Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said as he emerged Monday night from a meeting with Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Mr. Engel and four other Democratic committee leaders scheduled a 9 a.m. news conference for Tuesday in a stately Capitol reception room to lay out their plans.\nMr. Engel spoke an hour after the conclusion of a contentious Judiciary Committee hearing where Democratic lawyers testified that the evidence against Mr. Trump was overwhelming and demanded urgent action.\nSummarizing the findings of a two-month investigation by the Intelligence Committee, they asserted that the president had abused his office by soliciting re-election help from Ukraine, and then tried to conceal his actions from Congress.\n\"President Trump's persistent and continuing effort to coerce a foreign country to help him cheat to win an election is a clear and present danger to our free and fair elections and to our national security,\" Daniel S. Goldman, the Intelligence Committee lawyer who led the Ukraine inquiry, testified as he presented the evidence gathered against the president.\nThe presentations by Mr. Goldman and a Democratic lawyer for the Judiciary Committee will form the basis for a debate in the committee, expected to begin as soon as Wednesday, over whether to recommend the House adopt the articles of impeachment charging a president with high crimes and misdemeanors for only the third time in American history.\nEven as the hearing forecast the impeachment articles Democrats planned to lodge against Mr. Trump, it also offered hints about the kinds of charges that Democrats might avoid. \nDemocrats, for instance, did not use the term bribery, an offense explicitly mentioned in the Constitution as impeachable and one that leaders have used in the past to describe the president's conduct. And they did not discuss instances of potential obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump when he tried to thwart the special counsel's investigation of possible links between his campaign and Russian election interference.\nInstead, they used slickly excerpted video clips of testimony from senior diplomats and White House officials to accuse Mr. Trump of pressuring President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to announce investigations of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and an unsupported claim that Democrats conspired with Ukraine to interfere in the 2016 election. At the same time, they said, the president withheld as leverage a White House meeting and nearly $400 million in security assistance the country needed to hold off Russian aggression. \n\"This is a big deal,\" said Barry H. Berke, the counsel for Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, appealing to the deeply divided panel of lawmakers sitting before him. \"President Trump did what a president of our nation is not allowed to do.\"\nThe hearing, which unfolded over nine hours in the stately House Ways and Means Committee Room near the Capitol, featured bitter rounds of partisan sparring between Democrats and Republicans and testy cross-examinations of lawyers from both parties. Republicans arrived primed to challenge the Democrats' case and condemn the process they have used to assemble it. They repeatedly interrupted the Democrats' public presentation, and their own counsel used two separate addresses to try to dismantle it.\n\"Very simply, the evidence in the Democrats' impeachment inquiry does not support the Democrats' conclusion that President Trump abused his power for his own personal, political benefit,\" said Stephen R. Castor, a lawyer representing Republicans on both the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees.\nMr. Castor said there was \"simply no clear evidence\" that Mr. Trump had \"malicious intent in withholding a meeting or security assistance,\" and ample evidence that the president had legitimate concerns about corruption in Ukraine. And he accused Democrats of having gone \"searching for a set of facts on which to impeach the president,\" essentially manufacturing a scandal where there was none.\nThe White House once again refused to participate in the day's proceedings, despite appeals by Democrats to come to the table before it was too late. Mr. Trump and his allies, though, have now publicly turned their attention toward a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, where they believe they will have an easier time mounting a defense.\nBut that did not stop Mr. Trump himself from participating \u2014 at least via social media.\nAfter posting or reposting nearly 100 messages on Twitter on Sunday, most of them complaining about the impeachment effort and assailing Democrats, the president fired off more on Monday as the hearing progressed.\n\"The Do Nothing Democrats are a disgrace!\" Mr. Trump tweeted.\nFor now, Democrats have elected to press ahead without the White House's cooperation. The Judiciary Committee is likely to debate and vote on articles of impeachment by week's end, likely along party lines, recommending their adoption by the full House. That would set up a vote before Christmas to impeach Mr. Trump, and a Senate trial early in the new year.\nDuring the Judiciary Committee debate, individual lawmakers can propose changes to the articles leaders will unveil on Tuesday as well as additional articles, though they would be subject to a vote of the full committee.\nAs the impeachment inquiry marched forward, another investigation consumed Washington on Monday. The Justice Department's internal watchdog released a long-awaited report sharply criticizing the F.B.I. for its handling of a wiretap application in the early stages of its Russia investigation. But the report also undercut Mr. Trump's claims that former F.B.I. leaders tried to sabotage him for political reasons. Both Mr. Trump and his critics claimed vindication.\nBut it was competing written reports on the Ukraine matter submitted last week by Democrats and Republicans that preoccupied the House. Though the facts recited on Capitol Hill on Monday have become well known over the past two months, including through public testimony from a dozen witnesses, the hearing provided the clearest account yet of the respective cases.\nDuring his 45-minute presentation, Mr. Goldman described \"a monthslong scheme\" by the president \"to solicit foreign help in his 2020 re-election campaign, withholding official acts from the government of Ukraine in order to coerce and secure political interference in our domestic affairs.\"\nMr. Goldman said that Mr. Trump was continuing to this day to try to distort next year's election with false allegations, pointing to his statements to reporters over the weekend claiming that Rudolph W. Giuliani, his personal lawyer, would make a report to the Justice Department about Democrats.\n\"The scheme by President Trump was so brazen, so clear \u2014 supported by documents, actions, sworn testimony, uncontradicted contemporaneous records \u2014 that it's hard to imagine that anybody could dispute those acts, let alone argue that that conduct does not constitute an impeachable offense or offenses,\" said Mr. Berke, the Judiciary Committee lawyer.\nBoth lawyers also noted that the White House had systematically tried to obstruct their inquiry. A dozen witnesses, including senior White House officials who could shed light on key events, were blocked from testifying, and the Trump administration did not provide a single document to investigators despite several subpoenas.\nRepublicans lamented again and again that the Democrat who led the inquiry, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, did not testify himself about the report. They propped up a large poster on the dais that pictured a milk carton missing-person alert: \"Missing: Adam Schiff.\"\nEven after two and a half months of sparring, the complaints by Republicans reached new levels of vitriol. Democrats showed little patience for hearing out their criticisms, and Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the Judiciary Committee's chairman, made liberal use of his gavel as he tried to maintain order in the face of Republican efforts to interrupt the hearing with parliamentary tactics.\n\"Bang the gavel harder \u2014 still doesn't make it right,\" said Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee.\n\"They have talked about everything else, but they have offered not one substantive word in the president's defense,\" Mr. Nadler said of the Republicans in his closing remarks. In a letter sent during the hearing, he rejected Republicans' requests to call witnesses including Mr. Schiff, Mr. Biden's son Hunter and the anonymous C.I.A. whistle-blower whose complaint helped start the inquiry. Republicans could demand a vote on the matter at a later date.\nRepublican lawmakers fumed when Mr. Berke, who appeared at a witness table at the start of the hearing to deliver his argument against Mr. Trump, later climbed onto the dais and led the cross-examination of Mr. Castor, who was also representing the Intelligence Committee lawyer. It is highly unusual for House lawyers to testify in hearings, for Mr. Castor to be testifying on behalf of two committees and for one lawyer to question another in that way, but all were allowed under the rules.\n\"He's badgering the witness,\" Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, shot out as Mr. Berke pressed Mr. Castor. \n\"He is not,\" Mr. Nadler fired back.\nRepublicans seized on a small subset of evidence in the report to accuse Democrats of what Mr. Collins called \"a gratuitous drive-by\" targeting a conservative journalist and a Republican lawmaker. \nAt issue were a half-dozen subpoenas issued by Democrats that turned up call records between the journalist, John Solomon of The Hill; Representative Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee; and subjects of the investigation, including Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Collins said he had no problem with the subpoenas, but demanded to know who decided to name Mr. Nunes and Mr. Solomon in the report.\n\"Folks, you have made Joe McCarthy look like a piker,\" Mr. Sensenbrenner said.\nMr. Goldman declined to discuss investigative decisions, but said such identifications were typical when examining phone records in an inquiry like this. The calls noted in the report all took place around key events under scrutiny.\n\"We did not seek to do any investigation on a member of Congress or a staff member,\" Mr. Goldman said. \"It just happened to be they were in communication with a member of the president's scheme.\""}, {"idx": 28, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/us/politics/pelosi-impeachment.html", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Thursday that the House of Representatives would begin drafting impeachment articles against President Trump, pushing ahead with a rapid timetable that could set the stage for a vote before Christmas to charge him with high crimes and misdemeanors.\nInvoking the words of the Constitution and the nation's founders, Ms. Pelosi said it had become clear over two months of investigation that Mr. Trump had violated his oath of office by pressing a foreign power for help in the 2020 election. Allowing Mr. Trump to continue in office without remedy, she said, would come at \"the peril of our republic.\"\n\"His wrongdoing strikes at the very heart of our Constitution,\" Ms. Pelosi said in a formal address delivered against a backdrop of American flags in the Capitol. \"Our democracy is what is at stake. The president leaves us no choice but to act because he is trying to corrupt, once again, the election for his own benefit.\"\nMs. Pelosi's announcement came as the House Judiciary Committee laid out the next steps for its formal impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump. The committee said it would convene a hearing on Monday to allow its lawyers and those for the Intelligence Committee to formally present evidence in the inquiry. \nThe hearing may touch on one of the few remaining internal disputes among Democrats in an impeachment inquiry that has otherwise largely united them. Democrats must decide whether to limit their case to Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine, or include earlier allegations that he obstructed justice in trying to thwart the special counsel's Russia investigation.\nOn Thursday, returning to the ceremonial speaker's hallway where she announced in September that Democrats were initiating the inquiry, Ms. Pelosi sent a clear signal that she was confident Democrats had the votes they needed to impeach Mr. Trump. But the proceedings, unfolding less than a year before the 2020 election, will play out amid profound partisan divisions and pose political risks for Democrats and Republicans alike, as much as for the president himself.\nDemocrats familiar with the matter believe the judiciary panel is on track to begin publicly debating and voting on articles by the end of next week, despite uniform Republican opposition. That would lay the groundwork for a possible vote to impeach the president by Dec. 20, the final day this year that Congress is scheduled to be in session.\nA precise timeline for the next two weeks is among a long list of significant unknowns as Democrats march forward with an impeachment whose outcome appears all but certain. The White House, for instance, has until Friday to notify the Judiciary Committee whether it intends to present a defense or recommend new witnesses for testimony. If it does, the panel could be compelled to add a day or more of additional hearings, slowing the process.\nThe Senate completely omitted the month of January from a 2020 legislative calendar it published this week because of the uncertainty surrounding an impeachment trial.\nHours after announcing next steps, Ms. Pelosi erupted angrily when a reporter asked at a news conference if she hated Mr. Trump, repeating what Republicans have argued was her party's main motivation for going forward with impeachment.\nTurning on her heel on her way out of the briefing to answer, Ms. Pelosi strode back to her microphones for a lecture about her motivations. \n\"This is about the Constitution of the United States and the facts that lead to the president's violation of his oath of office,\" she said sharply. \"As a Catholic, I resent your using the word 'hate' in a sentence that addresses me. I don't hate anyone.\"\n\"So don't mess with me when it comes to words like that,\" she added.\nHer decision to move forward follows an inquiry by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee that concluded that Mr. Trump abused his power by pressuring President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to announce investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats, while withholding a White House meeting and $391 million in vital military assistance.\n\"Sadly, but with confidence and humility, with allegiance to our founders and a heart full of love for America, today I am asking our chairmen to proceed with articles of impeachment,\" she said during that announcement.\nAsked by reporters whether she feared political backlash or Democratic defections, Ms. Pelosi said the process was more important than politics. Of Democrats hesitant to vote in favor of impeachment, she said her team would \"catch them up.\" \nIn light of the facts uncovered so far, she added, the House had a duty to push forward with impeachment regardless of the anticipated outcome in the Senate, which she described as overseen by a \"rogue Senate leader who would just ignore the facts and the Constitution on all of this.\"\nBefore the announcement, Mr. Trump seemed to welcome the coming fight, calling Democrats \"crazy\" in a pair of tweets that urged them to proceed quickly so he could defend himself in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\"If you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair trial in the Senate, and so that our Country can get back to business,\" he wrote.\nAfterward, he said Democrats were trying to \"Impeach me over NOTHING,\" and setting a damaging precedent.\n\"This will mean that the beyond important and seldom used act of Impeachment will be used routinely to attack future Presidents,\" he tweeted. \"That is not what our Founders had in mind.\"\nThe White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, said Democrats had \"clearly abused their power,\" \"lied to the American people\" and \"made a mockery of the law.\" And Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican leader, said Thursday was \"not a day that history will be proud of.\"\nBrad Parscale, the manager of Mr. Trump's re-election campaign, circulated polling data on Twitter to argue that Ms. Pelosi was \"marching members of her caucus off the plank and into the abyss,\" adding, \"Impeachment is killing her freshman members.\"\nThe poll found that the majority of voters in the Oklahoma district of Representative Kendra Horn do not support impeachment. \nBut the numbers also illustrated why Democrats believe they are on solid ground in moving forward. In Ms. Horn's district, which Mr. Trump won in 2016 by 14 points, the poll found 45 percent supported his impeachment, compared with 52 percent who opposed it. If Ms. Horn, who won her district by 1 point, voted to impeach the president, only a minority of voters said they would be less likely to support her re-election. \nRecent national polls have found a slim majority supports the impeachment inquiry, but the public is split over whether Mr. Trump should be removed. \nMs. Pelosi limited advance notice of her announcement to a tight circle of advisers, but there have been clear signs this week that Democrats were preparing to move forward with impeachment articles. On Wednesday, after the legal scholars told the Judiciary Committee the facts of the case met the standards for impeachment, the committee's chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, said explicitly that Mr. Trump's conduct fit his three-part test for impeachment, and indicated his panel would press ahead with that in mind.\nIn saying that she was instructing \"chairmen\" to draft the charges, Ms. Pelosi left open the possibility that the other five panels that have investigated Mr. Trump and his administration could also play roles, a break with past practice. Those include the Intelligence Committee, which drew up the Ukraine report, and the Ways and Means Committee, which has pushed for the release of the president's tax returns. \nDuring her news conference, Ms. Pelosi framed the case against Mr. Trump as much broader than an isolated pressure campaign on Ukraine. She described an \"aha moment\" when she and other Democrats concluded that Mr. Trump's treatment of Ukraine was part of a larger pattern of deference toward Russia, a leading American adversary.\n\"This isn't about Ukraine; this is about Russia, who benefited by our withholding of that military assistance,\" Ms. Pelosi said. \"So sometimes people say, 'Well, I don't know about Ukraine, I don't know that much about Ukraine.' Well, our adversary is Russia. All roads lead to Putin. Understand that.\"\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Nadler's team made clear it was considering building charges going beyond the Ukraine matter, related to obstruction of the House's inquiry. A lawyer for the chairman, Norman Eisen, also asked the witnesses to evaluate whether possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump laid out by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who investigated whether the Trump campaign had ties to Russia's interference in the 2016 election, was impeachable as well. \nThe inclusion of the judiciary panel's lawyers in Monday's presentation of evidence suggested that obstruction of justice charges are still on the table. Before the Ukraine matter ever became public, Democrats on the committee spent months trying to build a case that Mr. Mueller's findings included impeachable conduct. \nRepublican lawyers for the judiciary and intelligence panels will also be allowed to present dissenting views. \nThe Intelligence Committee report released Tuesday laid out a broad framework for what articles of impeachment might look like. It found that the president had abused his power, endangered national security for his own personal benefit by seeking foreign interference in the 2020 election and obstructed Congress by ordering critical witnesses not to testify."}], "Peter Baker": [{"idx": 35, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/06/us/politics/trump-foreign-influence.html", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 One day in October 1992, four Republican congressmen showed up in the Oval Office with an audacious recommendation. President George Bush was losing his re-election race, and they told him the only way to win was to hammer his challenger Bill Clinton's patriotism for protesting the Vietnam War while in London and visiting Moscow as a young man.\nMr. Bush was largely on board with that approach. But what came next crossed the line, as far as he and his team were concerned. \"They wanted us to contact the Russians or the British to seek information on Bill Clinton's trip to Moscow,\" James A. Baker III, Mr. Bush's White House chief of staff, wrote in a memo later that day. \"I said we absolutely could not do that.\"\nPresident Trump insists he and his attorney general did nothing wrong by seeking damaging information about his domestic opponents from Ukraine, Australia, Italy and Britain or by publicly calling on China to investigate his most prominent Democratic challenger. But for every other White House in the modern era, Republican and Democratic, the idea of enlisting help from foreign powers for political advantage was seen as unwise and politically dangerous, if not unprincipled.\nA survey of 10 former White House chiefs of staff under Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bush, Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama found that none recalled any circumstance under which the White House had solicited or accepted political help from other countries, and all said they would have considered the very idea out of bounds.\n\"I served three presidents in the White House and don't remember even hearing any speculation to consider asking for such action,\" said Andrew H. Card Jr., who ran the younger Mr. Bush's White House and was the longest-serving chief of staff in the last six decades.\nWilliam M. Daley, who served as commerce secretary under Mr. Clinton and chief of staff under Mr. Obama, said if someone had even proposed such an action, he probably would \"recommend the person be escorted out of\" the White House, then fired and reported to ethics officials.\nOther chiefs were just as definitive. \"Did not happen on Reagan's watch. Would not have happened on Reagan's watch,\" said Kenneth M. Duberstein, his last chief of staff. \"I would have shut him down,\" said Leon E. Panetta, who served as Mr. Clinton's chief of staff and Mr. Obama's defense secretary.\nThe sense of incredulity among White House veterans in recent days crossed party and ideological lines. \"This is unprecedented,\" said Samuel K. Skinner, who preceded Mr. Baker as chief of staff under Mr. Bush. Other chiefs who said they never encountered such a situation included Thomas F. McLarty III and John D. Podesta (Clinton) and Rahm Emanuel, Denis R. McDonough and Jacob J. Lew (Obama).\nHistory has shown that foreign affairs can be treacherous for presidents, even just the suspicion of mixing politics with the national interest. As a candidate in 1968, Richard M. Nixon sought to forestall a Vietnam peace deal by President Lyndon B. Johnson just before the election.\nAssociates of Mr. Reagan were accused of trying to delay the release of hostages by Iran when he was a candidate in 1980 for fear that it would aid President Jimmy Carter, but a bipartisan House investigation concluded that there was no merit to the charge. Mr. Clinton faced months of investigation over 1996 campaign contributions from Chinese interests tied to the Beijing government.\nIn none of those cases did an incumbent president personally apply pressure to foreign powers to damage political opponents. Mr. Trump pressed Ukraine's president this summer to investigate involvement with Democrats in 2016 and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. while holding up $391 million in American aid. Mr. Trump has said he was simply investigating corruption, not trying to benefit himself.\n\"The right way to look at it is the vice president was selling our country out,\" Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, said in an interview on Sunday. Mr. Trump was fulfilling his duty, he said. \"I don't see what the president did wrong.\"\nMr. Giuliani has been leading Mr. Trump's efforts to dig up evidence of corruption by the Democrats in Ukraine, meeting with various officials and negotiating a commitment by the newly installed government in Kiev to investigate conspiracy theories about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election and supposed conflicts of interest by Mr. Biden.\nTold that past White House chiefs of staff said any legitimate allegations should be handled by the Justice Department, not the president, Mr. Giuliani said: \"That's if you can trust the Justice Department. My witnesses don't trust the Justice Department, and they don't trust the F.B.I.\" He added that he would not have either until Attorney General William P. Barr took over.\nMr. Barr has contacted foreign officials for help in investigating the origin of the special counsel investigation by Robert S. Mueller III into Russian interference and ties with Mr. Trump's campaign, part of an effort to prove that the whole matter was a \"hoax,\" as the president has insisted.\nMr. Trump defends himself by saying that other presidents have leaned on foreign governments for help. That is true, but when other presidents have pressured counterparts and even held up American assistance to coerce cooperation, it has generally been to achieve certain policy goals \u2014 not to advance the president's personal or political agenda.\nAs an example, Mr. Trump often cites Mr. Obama, who was overheard telling President Dmitri Medvedev of Russia in 2012 that he would have more \"more flexibility\" to negotiate missile defense after the fall election. While that may be objectionable, it is not the same thing as asking a foreign government to intervene in an American election.\n\"They assume everybody's as sleazy and dirty as they are, which is not the case,\" Mr. Emanuel said.\nMr. Trump points to Mr. Biden, arguing that the former vice president was the one who abused his power by threatening to withhold $1 billion in American aid to Ukraine unless it fired its prosecutor general.\nMr. Biden's son Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, earning $50,000 a month. The company's oligarch owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, had been a subject of cases overseen by the prosecutor, and so Mr. Trump contends that Mr. Biden sought the prosecutor's ouster to benefit his son.\nAs a matter of appearances, at least, the former vice president's family left him open to suspicion. Even some of his defenders say it was unseemly for Hunter Biden to seemingly trade on his family name. The elder Mr. Biden has said he never discussed his son's business dealings in Ukraine with him, but some Democrats suggest he should have if only to prevent just such a situation from arising.\nFor all of that, however, no evidence has emerged that Mr. Biden moved to push out the prosecutor to benefit his son. No memo or text message has become public linking the two. None of the American officials who were involved at the time have come forward alleging any connection. No whistle-blower has filed a complaint.\nIn pressing for the prosecutor's ouster, Mr. Biden was carrying out Mr. Obama's policy as developed by his national security team and coordinated with European allies and the International Monetary Fund, all of which considered the Ukrainian prosecutor to be deliberately overlooking corruption.\nIndeed, at the time Mr. Biden acted, there was no public evidence that the prosecutor's office was actively pursuing investigations of Burisma, although Mr. Zlochevsky's allies say the prosecutor continued to use the threat of prosecution to try to solicit bribes from the oligarch and his team.\nThe 1992 episode involving Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker provides an intriguing case study in the way previous administrations have viewed seeking political help overseas. At the time, Mr. Bush was trailing in the polls and eager for any weapon to turn things around.\nRepresentatives Robert K. Dornan, Duncan Hunter and Duke Cunningham of California and Sam Johnson of Texas urged the president to ask Russia and Britain for help.\nMr. Dornan, reached last week, said Mr. Baker offered no objections during the meeting. \"Baker sat there in the Oval Office like a bump on a log,\" he recalled. \"He said nothing.\" If Mr. Baker advised Mr. Bush not to reach out to foreign governments, then he did so after the congressmen had left, Mr. Dornan said.\nMr. Dornan said that was a mistake and that Mr. Bush should have done as Mr. Trump has. \"The bottom line from me was, 'If you don't do this, Mr. President, leader of the free world, you will lose,'\" Mr. Dornan said. \"And he didn't do it and he lost. Baker cost Bush that second term.\"\nAs it was, Mr. Baker and some of his aides got in trouble anyway because State Department employees searched Mr. Clinton's passport file to determine whether he had ever tried to renounce his American citizenship. They found no such evidence, but an independent counsel was appointed to investigate whether the search violated any laws.\nThe attorney general who requested the investigation? Mr. Barr, in his first tour running the Justice Department. The independent counsel who was appointed? Joseph diGenova, a lawyer now helping Mr. Giuliani look for information in Ukraine. In the passport case, Mr. diGenova concluded that no laws had been broken and that he should never have been appointed in first place.\nAs for seeking help from Russia and Britain, Mr. Baker declined to comment last week, but his peers said he did exactly as they would have. \"It would have been ludicrous at that stage to do anything,\" Mr. Skinner said. \"Baker's decision was obviously the right one.\""}, {"idx": 36, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/us/politics/jimmy-carter-hospital.html", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Former President Jimmy Carter was released from a Georgia hospital on Wednesday after being treated for a urinary tract infection, the latest of a string of health issues that he has endured in recent months.\nMr. Carter, 95, who became the longest-living president in American history in March, was discharged from Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus, Ga., his office said in a statement.\n\"He said he looks forward to further rest and recovery at home in Plains, Georgia,\" Deanna Congileo, his spokeswoman, said in the statement. \"He and Mrs. Carter wish everyone peace and joy this holiday season.\"\nMr. Carter was hospitalized over the weekend for the infection but his office gave few details. He has fallen and sustained serious injuries three times in the past seven months, at one point breaking a hip, at another point breaking his pelvis. He was hospitalized for more than two weeks last month after undergoing surgery to relieve pressure on his brain caused by the falls.\nMr. Carter served as the 39th president from 1977 to 1981 and left office after losing re-election to Ronald Reagan amid economic and foreign policy troubles. He has used his time since the White House to promote a variety of causes, including conflict resolution, eradication of certain diseases and other humanitarian goals.

Monday was one of those days. \nAn impeachment hearing on Capitol Hill presented radically competing versions of reality. An F.B.I. inspector general report punctured longstanding conspiracy theories even as it provided ammunition for others. And a trove of documents exposed years of government deception about the war in Afghanistan.\nWhile truth was deemed an endangered species in the nation's capital long before President Trump's arrival, it has become axiomatic in the era of \"alternative facts\" that each person or party entertains only their own preferred variant, resisting contrary information. Rarely has that been on display as starkly as on Monday, underscoring the deep distrust that many Americans harbor toward their leaders and institutions. \n\"We're in a dangerous moment,\" said Peter Wehner, a former strategic adviser to President George W. Bush and a vocal critic of Mr. Trump. \"The danger is people come to believe that nobody is giving them the facts and reality, and everybody can make up their own script and their own narrative.\" \nIn such a situation, he added, \"truth as a concept gets obliterated because people's investment in certain narratives is so deep that facts simply won't get in the way.\"\nMr. Trump, whose myriad false statements and public lies have been extensively cataloged, hardly caused this phenomenon by himself, but he exemplifies it better than anyone else. He is the Rorschach test of truth, the guidepost by which people choose their story line. Most Americans tell pollsters that they do not believe what he says, but a significant minority considers him a truth-teller in a broader sense, saying out loud what others will not about a broken system he vows to fix, even if he does not hew to particular facts.\nAnd in some ways, his what-you-see-is-what-you-get approach makes him more transparent about his motives and feelings than any president in generations. Rather than hide his more base reactions and ambitions, however raw and unseemly, he flaunts them and invites his supporters to share them. \nWith the help of social media, friendly news outlets and congressional Republicans willing to follow his lead, he crafts a message that finds its audience.\nHe took office at a time when trust was already a dwindling commodity in American life. Much of the public may not trust Mr. Trump, according to surveys, but it likewise does not trust his opponents all that much either \u2014 or the news media that he complains is out to get him. Americans have been down on banks, big business, the criminal justice system and the health care system for years, and fewer have confidence in churches or organized religion now than at any point since Gallup started asking in 1973.\n\"The story of the past half-century is the steady degradation of trust in the institutions and gatekeepers of American life,\" said Ben Domenech, the founder of The Federalist, a conservative news site. \"Everything from politics to faith to sports has been revealed as corrupted or corruptible. And every mismanaged war, failed hurricane response, botched investigation and doping scandal furthers this view.\"\nWhile a Quinnipiac Poll last spring found that Americans believed the news media more than Mr. Trump by a margin of 52 percent to 35 percent, other surveys showed a crisis among everyday people distinguishing fact from fiction in public life. Nearly two-thirds of Americans in a poll released last month by The Associated Press, the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and USAFacts said they often came across one-sided information, and 47 percent said they had difficulty knowing if the information was true.\nThe documents on Afghanistan made public on Monday could easily deepen that sense of suspicion. Some 2,000 pages of secret notes and interview transcripts compiled as part of a lessons-learned project and released to The Washington Post after a court fight showed that the government had misled the public about the war since its early months.\nAs Lt. Gen. Douglas E. Lute, who was an adviser on Afghanistan to Mr. Bush and President Barack Obama, admitted in a secret interview included in the documents, \"We were devoid of a fundamental understanding of Afghanistan \u2014 we didn't know what we were doing.\" But neither administration admitted that to the public. John F. Sopko, the head of the federal agency that conducted the interviews, told The Post that the documents showed \"the American people have constantly been lied to.\"\nThe F.B.I. inspector general report released on Monday typified the choose-your-own-reality nature of Washington these days. The report debunked Mr. Trump's conspiracy theories about the origins of the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, finding no \"political bias or improper motivation\" in opening the inquiry. But the inspector general also found that the bureau made serious mistakes in seeking a surveillance warrant.\nFormer F.B.I. officials took the report as vindication because it dispelled the many unfounded claims Mr. Trump and his supporters advanced about the bureau even as they fretted that too many people would still believe the president's assertions. \"There is a risk we've become so numb to the lying that we move onto the next outrage,\" the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey, who was fired by Mr. Trump, said on CNN.\nLikewise, the House Judiciary Committee impeachment hearing on Monday offered conflicting versions to suit either side's predilections \u2014 either the story of an out-of-control president abusing his power to pressure a foreign government to help him take down his domestic rivals or a president who just happened to be concerned about corruption in faraway Ukraine and did not tie American aid to his political priorities even though some of his own advisers thought he did.\nMr. Trump's insistence that he did nothing wrong has forced at least some Republicans to accept and promote his account even when it contrasts with available evidence. A Republican lawyer presenting the case to the committee on Monday went so far as to say that the evidence did not show that Mr. Trump asked Ukraine's president to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. during a now-famous July 25 phone call even though the White House's own reconstructed transcript quoted him asking his counterpart to \"look into it.\"\nMr. Trump is hardly the first dissembler in the White House. Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon were famously talented liars, and Bill Clinton was the first president ever found by a court to have testified falsely under oath. But what Mr. Trump lacks in finesse, he makes up in volume. The Post's fact-checking unit counted more than 13,000 false or misleading statements by Mr. Trump as of October.\nThe trials of truth have been a consistent theme of his presidency since its first day when he overstated his inaugural crowd size and within days falsely claimed that at least three million immigrants voted illegally against him, costing him the popular vote.\nThe culture of dishonesty has resulted in multiple people once in his inner circle pleading guilty or being convicted of lying to the authorities, including his onetime national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn; his former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen; several campaign aides; and most recently, his longtime associate and sometime adviser Roger J. Stone Jr., who was found guilty last month in a courthouse just across from the Capitol.\nMr. Trump's former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, made clear during testimony before Congress in September that he felt perfectly free to lie on television because, in his view, the news media itself was dishonest. \"I have no obligation to have a candid conversation with the media whatsoever, just like they have no obligation to cover me honestly, and they do it inaccurately all the time,\" he told lawmakers.\nThe president and his allies have sought to turn the tables on Democrats by accusing them of being the dishonest ones. Mr. Trump's favorite target is Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, which conducted the Ukraine inquiry in response to a C.I.A. whistle-blower. \nMr. Trump, who regularly accuses critics of whatever they have accused him of, has taken to calling the congressman \"Shifty Schiff\" and likewise complains that the parody he gave of Mr. Trump's July 25 call to make a point was dishonest even though Mr. Schiff made clear it was not a verbatim rendering. \nDemocrats dismissed the attacks on Mr. Schiff as a false-equivalence effort to distract from the president's own conduct. But they did not have Mr. Schiff present the evidence on Monday, leaving it to a lawyer instead, avoiding the distraction.\nThe attacks on Mr. Schiff and other Democrats give Mr. Trump and his supporters their own counternarrative amplified on conservative television and social media. By the end of Monday, each side took what it wanted from the day's developments and drew the conclusions that best reflected its views.\n\"In an atomized age,\" said Mr. Domenech, \"that allows individuals to retreat to their own story lines, fantasies and tales in which their tribe is always good or under attack, and the other always craven and duplicitous.\"\nFor Mr. Trump, that is a truth he can live with."}, {"idx": 38, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/02/us/politics/jimmy-carter-hospital.html", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Former President Jimmy Carter was hospitalized again over the weekend only days after being released, this time for a urinary tract infection, but he was recovering well, his office reported on Monday.\n\"He is feeling better and looks forward to returning home soon,\" Deanna Congileo, his spokeswoman, said in a statement. \"We will issue a statement when he is released for further rest and recovery at home.\"\nThe statement offered few details, saying only that he was admitted \"this past weekend\" to Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus, Ga., without saying exactly when or under what circumstances.\nMr. Carter, 95, who in March became the longest-living president in American history, has been hospitalized repeatedly in recent months for various falls and, most recently, for a procedure to reduce pressure on his brain. He fell and broke a hip in May, requiring surgery, then fell again twice in October, once resulting in 14 stitches days after his 95th birthday and then a second time fracturing his pelvis.\nLast month, he returned to the hospital for surgery to relieve pressure on his brain caused by bleeding from his recent falls. The procedure was described as a success, and he was released last Wednesday in time for Thanksgiving after two and a half weeks at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta.\nMr. Carter, the 39th president, served from 1977 to 1981, presiding over an often tumultuous period in American history. He brokered a landmark peace deal at Camp David between Israel and Egypt and pushed through treaties turning over the Panama Canal, but he lost re-election after a long-running hostage crisis in Iran."}, {"idx": 39, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/us/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry.html", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 When times turn tough, presidents can hop on Air Force One to escape the country for a while and stride purposefully across the world stage. But the world stage was not so friendly this week for President Trump, who landed back in Washington on Wednesday night to confront a grim couple of weeks ahead.\nMocked by peers behind his back at a NATO meeting in London, Mr. Trump abruptly canceled a news conference and bolted early, only to fly home to a capital in the throes of judging whether he is fit for office. After hobnobbing with the queen, the president now faces the daunting likelihood that by Christmas he will become the third president impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors.\nThe NATO meeting had seemed like an opportunity to demonstrate his global leadership like Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton sought to do with overseas trips during their own impeachment struggles. Scheduled long ago, the meeting allowed Mr. Trump and his allies to assail his domestic foes as \"unpatriotic\" for proceeding with an impeachment hearing while the commander in chief was overseas and gave him a chance to boast of his success in pressing the allies to invest more in defense.\nBut the visit was soured by a contentious meeting with President Emmanuel Macron of France and a hot-mic video that captured other world leaders making fun of Mr. Trump. In response, a sullen president said one of the leaders caught talking on the video, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, was \"two-faced,\" and then slipped out of town without the scheduled wrap-up session with reporters, seemingly intent on not further spoiling the image of a successful visit.\n[Politicians have a long history of being caught saying impolitic things. Let's roll the tape.]\n\"The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to belittle my VERY successful trip to London for NATO,\" he wrote on Twitter as Air Force One streaked across the Atlantic. \"I got along great with the NATO leaders,\" he added, claiming credit for persuading them to increase their military spending, although wildly inflating the actual numbers. \"No increase for U.S., only deep respect!\"\nQuarreling with foreign leaders, of course, never troubled Mr. Trump before and in some ways has domestic political appeal with a Republican base that cheers on his defiance.\n\"The president has never been much bothered by shaking up international conventions, so tussling with foreign leaders, by those standards, isn't a bad thing from his perspective,\" said Antonia Ferrier, a former aide to Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader. \"For many Americans, having their president stand up to foreign leaders is a sign of strength.\"\nSam Nunberg, a former political adviser to Mr. Trump, said the optics of the London visit would appeal to different elements of his base. \"He held contentious press conferences with world leaders who are disdained in conservative circles while also getting the all important 10 Downing Street visit and greeting with the queen at Buckingham Palace, which always plays well with mid and high income voters,\" he said.\nStill, Mr. Trump seemed bothered by the conversation between the other leaders. Mr. Trudeau seemed to deride Mr. Trump for going off schedule to answer questions from reporters on Tuesday. \"He was late because he takes a 40-minute news conference at the top,\" the prime minister told Mr. Macron, Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain and Princess Anne.\n\"You just watch his team's jaws drop to the floor,\" Mr. Trudeau said at another point in the video, expressing astonishment at Mr. Trump's behavior. The other leaders are seen smiling in seeming sympathy or adding their own unheard comments to the discussion.\nThe overheard conversation came after Mr. Trump and Mr. Macron had engaged in a somewhat testy public session earlier in the day. \"Let's be serious,\" Mr. Macron chided the president at one point during a discussion of Islamic State fighters. \nAt a separate session with reporters, Mr. Trump had complained that Mr. Macron's recent comments bemoaning American disengagement with NATO had been \"very, very nasty.\"\nThe joking may have touched a nerve with Mr. Trump, who has long resented elites he felt did not show him proper respect or welcome him into their circles, whether it was Manhattan business titans or Washington political veterans. He visibly seethed in 2011 when President Barack Obama ridiculed him from stage during a black-tie Washington dinner.\n\"Trump doesn't just want to be in the club, he wants to be the unquestioned leader and center of attention,\" said Gwenda Blair, a Trump biographer. \"It had to be both humiliating and infuriating that the other heads of state who were mocking him were untouchable by tweet or insulting nickname, but no doubt he was already calculating the next round of tariffs he would send their way.\"\nForeign trips were a relief for Mr. Nixon and Mr. Clinton at similar points in their presidencies. As Watergate bore down in the summer of 1974, Mr. Nixon traveled to the Middle East and then the Soviet Union, reinforcing his peacemaking initiatives. Mr. Clinton similarly headed to Russia and Northern Ireland just after a grand jury appearance in 1998 and then later in the fall to the Middle East.\nBut in both cases, any relief was short-lived. Mr. Nixon ended up resigning weeks after getting home, and Mr. Clinton was impeached by the House only days after his return. The complaints about impeachment interfering with foreign policy rang loud then as well; Mr. Clinton was in the midst of bombing Iraq for defying international weapons inspectors even as the House took its vote.\nThere is no escape for Mr. Trump either, not in foreign cities, not in the Oval Office and not on the television he stares at upstairs in the White House for hours each day. His presidency is tethered to impeachment, his legislative agenda mostly on hold, his foreign policy overshadowed, his re-election on the line. He takes refuge in the boisterous and jampacked campaign rallies he holds and in the morning and evening lineups on Fox News.\nWhile in London, Mr. Trump defiantly declared he would not watch the opening of the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment hearings because he would be too busy conducting affairs of state, even as he lashed out at Democrats as \"deranged,\" \"sick,\" \"nuts,\" \"crazy\" and, in one case, a \"maniac.\" But while his blue-and-white jet headed back to Washington, he (or aides operating his account in his name) nonetheless blitzed out a couple dozen tweets recirculating posts from Republican allies castigating the hearing as it progressed.\nAt the White House in his absence, the atmosphere was somewhat surreal. The televisions around the building were tuned to the various news networks, especially Fox News, as they broadcast the hearing, but the volume was usually muted and aides sought to go about their business. \nThe White House refused to participate in the hearing, arguing that the process has been rigged by partisan Democrats, but it did send a couple of aides to sit in the hearing room and monitor the proceedings.\nThe assumption there, as elsewhere, was that the hearing changed no minds and the course of the next few weeks is already set \u2014 the House will probably vote by the end of the year to impeach along party lines, and the Senate will then hold a trial in which the president will not be convicted, setting him up to litigate the case during his re-election campaign. \n\"While I wouldn't say impeachment is a good thing for the president, it is a highly divisive and partisan issue breaking down on party lines,\" Ms. Ferrier said. \"It has not changed people's minds on the president. His approval ratings are remarkably consistent, in particular with Republican voters, and he clearly relishes a fight.\"\nBut some who have been through this before said it was hard to put it aside. Dennis Ross, a foreign policy specialist who accompanied Mr. Clinton on his trip to the Middle East days before he was impeached, said that an impeachment vote remains part of a president's legacy, even if it does not lead to his removal.\n\"Even though he may feel that he will be acquitted in the Senate because Republicans will not break ranks, and however much he tries to turn this to his advantage at a later point, the truth is no matter how you slice it, you can't run away from the fact you were one of the few presidents who was impeached,\" Mr. Ross said. \"He obviously likes to be singled out, but not like this.\""}, {"idx": 40, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/30/us/politics/impeachment-presidents.html", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As President George Bush prepared to order American troops into war to eject Iraqi invaders from Kuwait, he feared it could end his presidency. \"If it drags out,\" he dictated to his diary on Dec. 20, 1990, \"not only will I take the blame, but I will probably have impeachment proceedings filed against me.\"\nEleven days later, in a letter to his children, he quoted a Democratic senator telling him that \"if it is drawn out,\" he should \"be prepared for some in Congress to file impeachment papers.\" On the day the war began, a Democratic congressman did just that, introducing a resolution of impeachment accusing him of \"conspiring to commit crimes against the peace.\"\nFortunately for Mr. Bush, the war was relatively brief and efforts to impeach him fizzled. But he was hardly the only president to worry. While President Trump is just the fourth commander in chief in American history to confront a serious threat of impeachment, the prospect hung over many of his predecessors, a nagging worry in the back of the mind for some, a constitutional sword of Damocles for others.\nImpeachment has served not just as a means for removing a corrupt president from office, as outlined in the Constitution \u2014 in fact, it has never actually accomplished that purpose. Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were both impeached by the House but acquitted after Senate trials, while President Richard M. Nixon resigned before the full House could vote. But impeachment has served as a deterrent, a consequence that presidents had to consider when making decisions that crossed into questionable territory.\nPresidents have been accused of high crimes and misdemeanors for misconduct and for disputed policy choices. They have been targeted for impeachment for abusing their power, withholding information from Congress and providing poor moral leadership. They have been threatened with removal for violating court orders, statutory law, the Constitution and even the United Nations Charter.\nBeyond Johnson, Nixon, Mr. Clinton and now Mr. Trump, lawmakers have filed formal impeachment resolutions against at least seven other presidents, meaning that one out of every four occupants of the White House has faced accusations of high crimes and misdemeanors, while others were threatened. Most of the time, the effort posed no serious jeopardy. But as with Mr. Bush, it could weigh on them nonetheless.\n\"Every president's concerned about his legacy and that leads them to be concerned about whether impeachment is a possibility,\" said Michael J. Gerhardt, a constitutional law professor at the University of North Carolina. \"Oftentimes, that leads them to be very vigilant to monitor misconduct \u2014 and sometimes they are and sometimes they're not.\"\nAs conceived by the framers of the Constitution, impeachment was never meant to remedy incompetence or policy differences, akin to a vote of no confidence in a parliamentary system, reserving it for larger offenses against the republic. But the framers never explained precisely what they meant and so each generation has, in effect, redefined it.\nThe first formal impeachment effort against a president came in 1843 when a House member introduced a resolution calling for an inquiry against President John Tyler for \"arbitrary, despotic and corrupt abuse of the veto power\" after he rejected two tariff bills favored by his own Whig Party. \nThe clash was a test of Tyler's legitimacy. He was the first vice president to succeed to the presidency after President William Henry Harrison died a month into his term and Tyler had no strong support in either political party. The matter came to a vote by the full House, which rejected the resolution 127 to 83.\nIn the years that followed, other presidents were threatened with impeachment. After President James K. Polk took the country to war with Mexico on misleading terms, opponents raised the prospect of impeachment. \"In my judgment, it is an impeachable offense,\" Daniel Webster declared at a rally in Boston's Faneuil Hall. \nA committee held hearings on impeaching President James Buchanan, widely considered the worst American commander in chief. Opponents talked about impeaching President Ulysses S. Grant amid corruption allegations against his administration. Even the sainted President Abraham Lincoln was warned by an adviser weeks into his administration that he might be impeached if he abandoned Fort Sumter.\nJohnson's impeachment by the House in 1868 followed previous attempts to impeach him on other charges. The House voted the year before to authorize an investigation of his conduct and the House Judiciary Committee reported an impeachment resolution but the full House defeated it 108 to 57. Only after he fired Edwin Stanton, the war secretary allied with the Radical Republicans in Congress, did the House vote to impeach Johnson.\nHis acquittal by a single vote in his Senate trial did not discourage future lawmakers from turning to impeachment. In 1896, a congressman introduced a resolution to impeach President Grover Cleveland in a dispute over the sale of bonds. During the Great Depression, President Herbert Hoover faced an impeachment resolution for increasing unemployment and taxes, a tad belated since it was submitted in December 1932, a month after he lost re-election.\nIn April 1952, the House debated impeaching President Harry S. Truman three days in a row after he seized the nation's steel mills to thwart a worker strike during the Korean War. The resolution also charged him for sending troops to Korea under United Nations command without congressional approval and firing Gen. Douglas MacArthur. In the end, it never came to a vote but the Supreme Court invalidated the steel plant seizure.\nLike Johnson, Nixon faced down impeachment before Watergate. Three resolutions were introduced against him in 1972 charging him, among other things, with breaking off peace talks to end the Vietnam War and escalating the air war. None were acted on and Nixon was re-elected. \nBut 17 more resolutions were introduced over the next year focused on his secret war in Cambodia, the firing of the Watergate prosecutor and illegal wiretapping of journalists and critics. Twenty more resolutions were later introduced. Yet when the House Judiciary Committee ultimately approved three articles against him, lawmakers kept them focused on Watergate.\nPresident Ronald Reagan was threatened with impeachment twice. Eight House members introduced a resolution to impeach him in 1983 over his invasion of Grenada, which was referred to committee and never acted on. Four years later, Representative Henry B. Gonzalez of Texas introduced six articles of impeachment stemming from the Iran-contra scandal. The White House feared impeachment was a real danger, but Democratic congressional leaders decided not to proceed to avoid a divisive fight.\nThe same Mr. Gonzalez introduced the impeachment resolution against Mr. Bush on Jan. 16, 1991, as the Persian Gulf war opened, then proposed a second one a month later. Neither was acted on. \nMr. Clinton, like Johnson and Nixon before him, was targeted for impeachment more than once. Eighteen House members offered a resolution calling for an inquiry in 1997, a year before the independent counsel Ken Starr filed his report leading to Mr. Clinton's impeachment for perjury and obstruction of justice to cover up an affair with a former White House intern.\nPresident George W. Bush faced impeachment efforts by backbench Democrats over the invasion of Iraq on what turned out to be false reports that Baghdad had unconventional weapons. By Mr. Bush's last year in office, one Democratic opponent had collected so many complaints that he submitted 35 articles of impeachment, including for failing to adequately respond to Hurricane Katrina; they were sent to committee and not acted on. \nSome conservative Republicans talked about impeaching President Barack Obama over everything from the Benghazi attack to the birther conspiracy theory without following through. But Mr. Obama took the possibility more seriously in 2013 when he considered a military strike against Syria to retaliate for a chemical weapons attack on civilians, a factor that influenced his decision to abort the plan. A few months later the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing in which Republicans discussed impeaching Mr. Obama, although it went nowhere.\nFew if any elected presidents faced talk of impeachment as early as Mr. Trump. Days after his election in 2016, speculation began because of his many ethical issues. Mr. Trump now complains that Democrats have been out to get him from the start and are only using the Ukraine matter as an excuse; his opponents say that Mr. Trump has violated standards so many times that he brought this on himself.\nEither way, this moment might resonate for many of his predecessors. \"Any time you have a president who pushes the boundaries \u2014 and Trump has been pushing them since day one \u2014 he's going to push too far and there's going to be pushback,\" Mr. Gerhardt said. \"And impeachment is the core of any pushback.\""}], "Eileen Sullivan": [{"idx": 41, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/us/politics/noah-feldman.html", "text": "Noah Feldman, a professor at Harvard Law School, is part of a vanishing breed, a public intellectual equally at ease with writing law review articles, books aimed at both popular and scholarly audiences and regular opinion columns, all leaning left but with a distinct contrarian streak.\nIn October, he declared that the country was in a constitutional crisis, caused by the events that followed the disclosure of a July 25 phone call between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. When Mr. Trump told Congress that he would not participate in any of the House's impeachment proceedings, it left the country with a \"situation where the Constitution does not provide a clear, definitive answer to a basic problem of governance,\" Mr. Feldman wrote.\nMr. Feldman, 49, specializes in constitutional law and the relationship between law and religion and free speech. A graduate of Harvard and Yale Law School and a Rhodes Scholar, he clerked for Justice David H. Souter of the Supreme Court. Justice Souter was appointed by a Republican president, and was expected to serve as a conservative voice on the court, but he later regularly sided with the liberal wing. \nWith years of teaching constitutional law at some of the country's most elite institutions, Mr. Feldman will bring a deep analysis of different aspects of the Constitution and a lot of historical context. A prolific writer, he has written eight books and been published broadly, including in The New York Times Magazine and Bloomberg News.

Biden Jr. and his son, Hunter Biden.\nA day before Mr. Holmes's testimony, Mr. Sondland publicly implicated the president and other senior administration officials in the pressure campaign against Ukraine.\nIn the Fox interview, Mr. Trump hit on a theme that Democrats and witnesses have raised during the impeachment hearings \u2014 how was it that Mr. Sondland, with no foreign policy experience and who was not the ambassador to Ukraine, found himself leading the United States policy with Ukraine.\n\"But he was really the European Union ambassador, and all of a sudden he's working on this,\" Mr. Trump said on Friday. \"Ask about that.\"\nMr. Sondland told lawmakers that Mr. Trump directed him to do so. \nIn response to a cryptic tweet from John R. Bolton, his former national security adviser who has so far declined to testify in the House impeachment inquiry, Mr. Trump was asked whether he had frozen Mr. Bolton's Twitter account.\n\"No, of course not. Of course not,\" Mr. Trump said. \"No, I actually had a good relationship with John.

Giuliani, in foreign policy involving Ukraine was disruptive and damaging to the American goal of helping Ukraine defend itself against Russia. While Mr. Holmes described how the Giuliani-led campaign evolved starting in March, Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and the ranking member on the House Intelligence committee, focused on one date \u2014 July 25 \u2014 when Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky spoke to each other by phone.

Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, delivered explosive testimony to the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday in the latest round of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry.\nIn his opening statement, Mr. Sondland directly implicated members of the Trump administration \u2014 including President Trump himself \u2014 in a pressure campaign on Ukraine to launch investigations into Mr. Trump's political rivals. Here are some key takeaways from Mr. Sondland's testimony.\nMr. Sondland told the committee that Mr. Trump directed the Ukraine pressure campaign, that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo signed off, and that Vice President Mike Pence was told about an apparent link between Ukraine's military aid and the investigations the president desired. He confirmed that there was a \"clear quid pro quo\" for a White House meeting between Mr. Trump and Ukraine's president.\nMr. Sondland explained to the Democrats' chief counsel that Mr. Trump's demand on Ukraine seemed to prioritize the announcement of investigations into his rivals more than it did completing an actual investigation. As far as Mr. Trump was concerned, Ukraine's announcement that it was investigating the Bidens as part of Mr. Zelensky's anti-corruption agenda could be damaging enough. \nMr. Sondland told lawmakers about interactions with senior administration officials who have tried to keep some distance from the pressure campaign.

But two Intelligence Committee lawyers are asking many of the questions.\nAccording to special House rules, the chairman of the House Intelligence committee, Adam B. Schiff, and the top Republican on the panel, Devin Nunes, both from California, can delegate some or all of their time to staff lawyers to question witnesses about the interactions of Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. \nThe lawyers are not elected officials but have seized attention by asking questions about the investigations Mr. Trump and his private lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani wanted Ukraine to pursue into Mr. Trump's political rivals, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \nHere is what we know about the lawyers, Daniel S. Goldman and Stephen R. Castor.\nThe Democrats' lawyer, Daniel S. Goldman, joined the House Intelligence Committee earlier this year, bringing expertise in prosecuting criminals and mobsters as a former assistant United States attorney in New York. Mr. Goldman, a 43-year-old father of five, is also well-versed in talking about investigations into President Trump as a paid legal expert on MSNBC. Republicans who have spent dozens of hours with Mr. Goldman sequestered in the Intelligence Committee's basement offices conceded they had come to have a grudging respect for his work.\nMr. Goldman has been open about his low opinion of Mr. Trump. In a Twitter post last December, Mr. Goldman compared Mr. Trump to mob bosses he had prosecuted, saying \"Mob bosses are far smarter and way more savvy and discrete than Trump.\" \nThat same month, he wrote that the president, \"doesn't care about the country, just himself. Shameful.\" He used the hashtag #TrumpResign and LOL-ed in response to one of Mr. Trump's many \"Witch Hunt!\" tweets. \nA few months later, Mr. Goldman joined the Intelligence Committee at a time when Mr. Schiff was focused on the special counsel investigation into the Trump campaign's possible ties with Russia in 2016. Much of Capitol Hill was fixated on the inquiry, as was Mr. Trump. \nWhen Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, released his report without recommending any criminal charges against Mr. Trump, the Democrats' momentum to investigate the president deflated a bit. But that changed in August, when an anonymous C.I.A. officer filed a whistle-blower complaint. Once Mr. Schiff learned about the complaint's existence, he pushed the Trump administration to share it with Congress, at which point Mr. Goldman's job got a lot more interesting.\nIn questioning key witnesses in private depositions and in public, Mr. Goldman brings the staccato cadence of a seasoned prosecutor, often asking witnesses questions that would elicit \"yes\" or \"no\" responses. His years in the high profile United States attorney's office in the Southern District of New York and his time on MSNBC prepared him for the spotlight of the televised impeachment proceedings.\nDuring one of the public hearings last week, Mr. Goldman asked the top American in Ukraine \u2014 William B. Taylor Jr. \u2014 about the July 25 phone call and alternate Ukraine foreign policy channel at the center of the impeachment inquiry.\n\"Ambassador Taylor, in your decades of military service and diplomatic service representing the United States around the world, have you ever seen another example of foreign aid conditioned on the personal or political interests of the President of the United States?\" Mr. Goldman asked. \nMr. Taylor responded: \"No, Mr. Goldman, I have not.\"\nStephen R. Castor, according to a longtime Republican oversight staff member who was not authorized to speak publicly, cares about four things in life: His family, his dogs, the Phillies and congressional oversight. \nMr. Castor, 46 and a father of two, once said he knew he wanted to be a congressional staffer as early as law school. Aside from a few years in the private sector working in law firms in Philadelphia and Washington, Mr. Castor has lived his dream. \nSince 2005, Mr. Castor has worked for Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, where he questioned witnesses about the federal response to Hurricane Katrina and the Obama-era botched gun trafficking investigation called Operation Fast and Furious. Mr. Castor also questioned witnesses in the House investigation into the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, that left four Americans dead. That investigation, led by Republicans and especially fixated on Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, was one of the longest and most bitterly partisan inquiries in history. \nIn 2013, Mr. Castor explained that committee investigators like him are responsible for persuading whistle-blowers to come forward. \n\"We're in the storytelling business, the business of putting the pieces together,\" Mr. Castor said in an interview with Bloomberg during the House Oversight Committee's investigation into political bias in the Internal Revenue Service during the Obama administration.\n\"The purpose of an oversight investigation is not to simply try and make the president look bad,\" Mr. Castor said at the time. \"This administration is uncomfortable with oversight.\" \nSix years later, Mr. Castor, in closed-door testimonies, has stuck to the Republican strategy of pushing back against witness accounts and credibility, and hammering the Democrats about the process of the proceedings. When he first questioned the top American in Ukraine, Mr. Taylor, Mr. Castor lamented that Republicans were often in the dark about, for instance, subpoenas. \n\"And that leads to mistrust,\" Mr. Castor said.\nWhen Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio and a fierce defender of the president, joined the intelligence committee last week so that he could infuse more moxie into the public portion of the inquiry, Mr. Castor came with him to question many of the same witnesses in a public forum. \nOn Friday, Mr. Castor questioned Mr. Taylor about the 2016 presidential campaign. \n\"The run-up to the 2016 election, there's many facts that remain unresolved, agreed?\" Mr. Castor asked Mr. Taylor.\nMr. Taylor responded, \"I'm sorry, what's the question?\""}], "James Butler": [{"idx": 48, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/13/opinion/uk-election-boris-johnson.html", "text": "LONDON \u2014 Boris Johnson gambled everything on an election and won.\nCalled to resolve the intractable problem of Brexit, the election on Thursday \u2014 undertaken in winter, itself a sign of political crisis \u2014 delivered the Conservative Party its first commanding majority in over 40 years. The scale and shape of the victory surpassed projections: Parliament will be full of acquiescent Conservative legislators while the opposition Labour Party teeters on the precipice of civil war.\nMr. Johnson now has the means to do as he pleases. At the end of his term in five years, Britain will be a very different place. Out of the European Union for a start, but perhaps also no longer a union of nations. In its sinews and its structure, its economy and its culture, British society will be forever changed by Mr. Johnson's premiership. \nAt the start, this election did not seem likely to usher in transformative change. Voters appeared displeased with the whole affair, and the course of the campaign itself was distinguished by evasion and mendacity, especially from the Conservative Party and its leader. The chief slogan, \"Get Brexit Done,\" was plastered over all their materials, while their spending promises \u2014 a partial reversal of the austerity worldview that has characterized Conservative economic policy since 2010 \u2014 were sold as being possible only after Brexit was resolved. The party presented Brexit as a simple hurdle, rather than a process likely to take a decade. For an election that hinged on the subject, there was surprisingly little detailed conversation about it. \nInstead, Mr. Johnson and his campaign team concentrated on the threat from Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party, whose tenure is in effect finished. They briefed vastly inflated figures in tax costs that then circulated in huge \u2014 often third-party funded \u2014 digital ad buys, as well as constant coverage in the press. Mr. Johnson's advisers also shielded him from difficult interviews and effective scrutiny \u2014 depositing him in a fridge at one point to avoid an early morning interview. The press did little to counteract such slipperiness, and at times seemed even to connive in it.\nBy contrast, Labour's campaign attempted to make the election effectively a referendum on austerity and the past decade of Conservative rule \u2014 and especially the risk to the National Health Service from an American trade deal. Its manifesto was by some way the most serious, especially on climate change. And it mobilized many thousands of activists in door-knocking campaigns, and mounted a huge digital campaign. But between Mr. Corbyn's personal unpopularity, a media focused, often inanely, on Brexit, and four years of attacks on the leadership by dissatisfied backbenchers \u2014 as well as a sometimes dizzying number of policies \u2014 it was hard to cut through the noise.\nThe result is clear: The electoral map has been redrawn. Scotland, in disgust, returned a near full sweep for the Scottish National Party, all but wiping out both major parties. In England and Wales, the story was more stark still. Seats held by the Labour Party since the end of World War II fell to the Conservatives, as the party faced bruising losses in areas it has long regarded as its heartlands. The loss of dozens of seats across the Midlands and the North \u2014 including Blyth Valley, a former mining constituency ranked at 116 on the Tory target list \u2014 testifies to the depth of the defeat and ensures Labour's vote is much more geographically constrained to the major cities.\nMany voters will look at an unfamiliar country and grasp for explanations. Many, especially in the cities where Labour made its few gains on Thursday night, will reach for Brexit \u2014 that traditional Labour voters who opted to leave in the 2016 referendum wanted above all to see Brexit carried out, and so either voted for the Conservatives or abstained altogether. But Brexit is a symptom and an accelerant, not an explanation in itself. Many of the seats Labour lost in this election have been taken for granted by the party for a long time. It is little wonder that leave voters in such seats felt scant loyalty to a party committed, after much agonized prevarication, to a second referendum. \nBrexit is also an opportunity for Mr. Johnson: It offers him the chance to remake the economic and political foundations of Britain. He will likely pass his Brexit deal through Parliament before Christmas. But when Britain finally floats free of the European Union, some of the delusions driving Mr. Johnson's Brexit \u2014 a swashbuckling Global Britain, Empire 2.0 \u2014 will be decidedly dashed. The trade world is likely to be much more brutal; Britain's economy, already replete with ill-paying, gig-economy jobs, will surely suffer. Whether this sobriety hits before the June deadline for Mr. Johnson to request an extension \u2014 which his manifesto ruled out \u2014 to negotiations on a new trade deal with the bloc is an open question. But while traditional Conservative voters can afford the turbulence of a hard exit, his newly-acquired constituents cannot. \nThough now less restive, Parliament will not all be plain sailing for Mr. Johnson, either. Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the ascendant Scottish National Party, has signaled her intention to hold a new referendum on independence next year. Meanwhile, the special status accorded to Northern Ireland in Mr. Johnson's deal infuriates many Unionists \u2014 and could accelerate moves toward a United Ireland. Major constitutional showdowns seem likelier as Brexit shakes out. A confrontation between Ms. Sturgeon and Mr. Johnson seems inevitable.\nNor is it certain that the Tories' spending plans, hardly extensive, will survive any economic impacts from Brexit. We may experience a bout of early Reagan-style spending from the right \u2014 some hospitals here, some schools there \u2014 but it's unlikely to adequately stem the crisis in social care or holes in local government budgets.\nWhat is certain is that the Conservatives will pursue their manifesto promises with zeal. They will pursue headline-grabbing measures, like redrawing constituency boundaries and legislating for voter ID checks, widely understood as locking in Conservative electoral advantage. They plan a sweeping review of the Constitution, including the powers of the Supreme Court, widely perceived as revenge for it stymying Mr. Johnson earlier this year. \nThey promise a euphemistic \"update\" of the Human Rights Act, more respectable than previous manifesto commitments to scrap it outright. They promise criminalization of Roma and Travellers, another traditionally nomadic population, along with powers to confiscate their property. They promise the conventional Tory red meat of more draconian sentencing and ever harsher borders. These are terrifying prospects. \nAs Britain has learned before, bitterly, Conservatives do not squander their majorities. Now they have a big one, and five full years to use it."}, {"idx": 49, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/opinion/brexit-vote-johnson-uk.html", "text": "This article has been updated to reflect news developments.\nLONDON \u2014 Boris Johnson has begun with defeat. \nLegislators voted on Tuesday night to seize control of Parliament, alarmed by the prime minister's insistence that he will take Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31, even if no deal with the bloc has been reached. On Wednesday, they took steps to force Mr. Johnson to ask for an extension to the deadline if he still has no deal. And then they refused the prime minister's call for an early election.\nIt is a week of high political drama in Westminster \u2014 and the culmination of over two years of intricate tactical maneuvers and procedural minutiae that have marked British politics.\nTime is so short because Mr. Johnson last Wednesday \"prorogued\" parliament, mothballing it for five weeks from next week: If the bill fails to become law by that point, it automatically falls. The unusual length of the suspension has already occasioned protests across Britain. Demonstrators called it a \"coup,\" and the speaker of the House of Commons called it a \"constitutional outrage.\"\nYet on Tuesday night, with Parliament having again flexed its long dormant democratic muscle, it was Mr. Johnson who looked isolated. Furious, he vowed to seek new elections \u2014 when he'll get them remains to be seen \u2014 and stripped the whip from all his rebels, including prominent party grandees, effectively barring them from running again as Conservative candidates.\nThe conflict has laid bare deep tensions in Britain's democracy \u2014 between the prime minister and Parliament, and between the people and the politics that claims to represent them.\nBritain's Parliament is anomalous. Having failed to sustain its 17th-century deposition of the monarchy, and having been the imperial power rather than the colonized one, Britain has never had a founding constitutional moment. Instead its democracy has evolved within an accreted mass of archaic institutions, including an unelected upper chamber that was until the late 20th century composed of hereditary aristocrats. This grandeur itself has sometimes been thought to be a powerful conservative influence: The Labour politician Nye Bevan once wrote it \"lies like an Alp\" on the mind of a new member of Parliament.\nUnder its ritual pomp, Parliament's curious evolution has made it unusually powerful. A prime minister with a substantial majority has broad latitude to remake the country, as Margaret Thatcher and to a lesser extent Tony Blair did. But without a solid majority, Parliament has great power to resist even the most ambitious leader.\nLegislators' tactics this week are not entirely new: A similar procedure was used to take control and force Theresa May, Mr. Johnson's predecessor, to seek an extension in April. But the complexity of the new bill \u2014 which intends to prescribe Mr. Johnson's approach to the European Union in exacting detail \u2014 reflects the total breakdown in trust between executive and legislature. \nApril's version of the bill passed partly because Mrs. May recognized she had lost; Mr. Johnson will use every means at his disposal to frustrate the new bill, including attempts to filibuster its progress in the unelected upper house. Promising a scorched earth, the prime minister is effectively at war with the Parliament for which he once promised to \"take back control.\"\nDespite the throng of demonstrators outside Parliament \u2014 roared slogans and vast European Union flags are a daily backdrop to news broadcasts \u2014 the political progress of Brexit has been a markedly institutional affair, conducted through arcane procedural instruments and prominent court battles. The alien language of parliamentary procedure \u2014 \"prorogation,\" \"humble addresses,\" \"paving motions\" \u2014 is parsed for an unfamiliar public by constitutional experts who have rarely been in such demand. \nThe interviews with members of the public that dot the news vary from bafflement to outright loathing of politics; enthusiasm is a rare beast. According to Hansard Society research, civic trust is threadbare: Only a third of people trust politicians to act in the public interest, and just under half feel they have no influence at all on decision-making.\nBritain's withdrawal from the European Union was always likely to be a vastly complex technical matter, and the bloc's tendency to conduct politics through intricate sequencing lends itself to squabbles over procedural minutiae. But the cause of the proliferating conflict in British politics has always been domestic: Despite losing her majority in 2017, Mrs. May's conduct of Brexit was distinguished by her autocratic instincts and determination to avoid parliamentary consultation. \nThe same highhanded conduct saw her first dragged to the Supreme Court to assert Parliament's right of a \"meaningful vote,\" and then locked in a battle with Parliament over the disclosure of the attorney general's legal advice. That battle saw her censured for \"contempt of Parliament.\" The phrase epitomizes her successor's entire attitude.\nOne consequence of the prominence of procedural conflicts since the Brexit referendum has been to transfer the political questions which drove it into arguments about legal permissibility. Questions about the kind of state the Britain wishes to be, relations among its constituent nations, its draconian attitudes to migrants, its vexed history in Ireland, how it makes domestic political choices and how far it wishes economic integration with other European states \u2014 all are folded into, and sometimes disappear in, conflicts over parliamentary rights and legal obligations. \nIt is then no wonder that apparently arid matters suddenly take on intense but displaced political energy \u2014 the kind that saw High Court judges branded \"enemies of the people\" on the front pages of the tabloid press and that turned usually pacific sections of society into ardent protesters.\nThe institutional confinement of the Brexit process has been seized on by Dominic Cummings, the former director of Vote Leave, now Mr. Johnson's chief adviser and architect of his hard-line strategy. Mr. Cummings recognizes a fault line in Britain's democratic structure: between an exercise conducted by plebiscite \u2014 the Brexit referendum \u2014 and the conventional, deliberative methods used to interpret and deliver the consequences of that vote. \nBy painting the referendum as the sole truly democratic exercise, with all subsequent debates and concerns over rights a matter of cynical pettifogging and anti-Brexit trickery, he believes he can deliver a reconfigured political landscape, straddled by Mr. Johnson as a flaxen-haired avatar of the popular will.\nPerhaps Mr. Cummings has in mind that half the people surveyed by Hansard claimed they longed for a strong leader to \"break the rules\" of politics. Yet the strongman has feet of clay. If suspending Parliament was intended to demonstrate Mr. Johnson's credentials as a champion of the people, it managed to unite only 27 percent of them. Further overreach as the prime minister attempts to break Parliament to his will is unlikely to improve that number.\nNobody doubts new elections are on the horizon, the central issues of which will be shaped in the next weeks. It will be an election that Mr. Johnson intends to fight on a narrow Brexit question. To beat him, the Labour Party, which has been as troubled by division between the two Brexit camps as the country as a whole, will not only need a clear message on Brexit but also some means of bridging its divide. Democracy could be a powerful theme: not just its defense in Parliament but its extension beyond Parliament's feudal residues and monarchical hangovers, into Britain's regions and its antiquated electoral system.\nIt is widely known that Mr. Johnson wants a \"people versus politicians\" election. Perhaps it is time for the opposition to push for \"the country versus Boris Johnson.\""}, {"idx": 50, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/opinion/boris-johnson-prime-minister-britain.html", "text": "LONDON \u2014 Boris Johnson, to whom lying comes as easily as breathing, is on the verge of becoming prime minister. He faces the most complex and intractable political crisis to affect Britain since 1945.\nThat should be concerning enough. But given Britain's political system \u2014 which relies for its maintenance on the character and disposition of the prime minister \u2014 it carries even graver import. Mr. Johnson, whose laziness is proverbial and opportunism legendary, is a man well practiced in deceit, a pander willing to tickle the prejudices of his audience for easy gain. His personal life is incontinent, his public record inconsequential.\nAnd his premiership could bring about the end of Britain itself.\n[Boris Johnson was chosen as Theresa May's successor on Tuesday.]\nThe state of the United Kingdom, a constitutional compact founded in 1922 and stretching back, in one form or another, for centuries, is severely strained. Though Brexit is primarily driven by English passions, two of the four territories in the Union \u2014 Northern Ireland and Scotland \u2014 voted to remain. Both present immediate problems for Mr. Johnson \u2014 and for the future of Britain.\nIn Scotland, rancor at the sense that the country's vote counted for little and subsequent repeated bouts of parliamentary chaos have led to renewed calls for a second independence ballot. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, insists Scotland will hold one if Brexit takes place. One of the most adroit politicians in Britain, Ms. Sturgeon knows that despite widespread misgivings about Brexit, the majority needed for independence does not currently exist. But recent polling suggests a Johnson government might tilt the scales in her favor. An independent Scotland may be conjured out of the chicanery of Mr. Johnson's rule.\nIn Northern Ireland, Mr. Johnson is beholden to the Democratic Unionist Party, a hard-line Northern Irish Protestant party on which he will depend for a majority in Parliament. That severely curtails his room for maneuver as he attempts, one way or the other, to take Britain out of the European Union. The D.U.P. will not countenance separation from the rest of the United Kingdom \u2014 hence why the so-called backstop, effectively an insurance plan to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and its southern neighbor, fatally scuttled Theresa May's thrice-rejected deal. It is hard to see how Mr. Johnson can extricate himself from this problem, whose protraction may have a decisive effect on the country's internal politics. Calls for a United Ireland, encouraged by demographic change and the waning of unionist sentiment, appear to be gathering more support.\nThe traditional solution to such an impasse is to call fresh elections. But here too there are problems for Mr. Johnson. Current polls show a fluctuating four-way split with Nigel Farage's Brexit Party, which peeled off much of the Conservative vote in the recent European elections, the Liberal Democrats and the Labour Party. Tory activists believe only Mr. Johnson can woo back the faithful from Mr. Farage, but if he steers the party farther right it would be likely to lose more liberal-leaning seats. Though the temptation of a resounding victory may pull on Mr. Johnson's vanity, the risk of a disastrous rout from a split base, handing Downing Street to Jeremy Corbyn and shattering the Tories, will surely be too great. And any successor to Mrs. May will fear the unpredictability of a snap election.\nNo way out there then. And the overall political situation has only worsened since Mrs. May's resignation. The European Union \u2014 newly configured after parliamentary elections, with an incoming head of the commission who has emphatically ruled out reopening negotiations with Britain \u2014 is likely to be short on patience and good will. (It doesn't help, of course, that its officials regard Mr. Johnson as a dangerous buffoon.) \nAt home, the rise of the Brexit Party constrains his options further. In part to nullify its threat, he has promised that unless a deal is reached by the end of October, the deadline for Britain's departure from the bloc, he will leave without one. And as Parliament, which remains intractably divided, is very unlikely to ratify anything Mr. Johnson presents, a No Deal exit looks far from impossible. The consequences of such a development cannot be foreseen \u2014 but they will surely not redound to the benefit of Britain.\nSo, the political situation is inclement, the room for maneuver limited, the stakes high. For another politician, assuming power in such circumstances would be daunting \u2014 but not necessarily dangerous. In a system that grants significant autonomy to prime ministers and relies on their propriety, character matters. The same scenario can play out differently in different hands. That's why, in the end, analysis comes back to Mr. Johnson and his terrible personality.\nHe prizes victory above government \u2014 his first ambition as a child was to be \"world king\" \u2014 and his political career has been marked by ferocity of campaigning and indifference in office, as both London mayor and foreign secretary. His contempt of scrutiny is plain to see: He was irked and petulant when challenged over budget cuts, the waste of public money on vanity projects or diplomatic gaffes. His easy talk of parliamentary prorogation \u2014 effectively suspending the legislature \u2014 may be a taste of the chaos to come.\nHe seems not to have principles. In the late '90s he told a surprised colleague he was \"worried I haven't got any political opinions\" \u2014 before going on to rehearse a hit parade of right-wing classics about \"picanninies\" and \"bum boys\" in his Telegraph column. While the insight into the void at the heart of Mr. Johnson's blond ambition is striking, there are some constants to his politics other than his spectacular mendacity: his defense of bankers and pursuit of tax cuts, and a loathing for those who call him to account over facts.\nReality will prove unavoidable on Oct. 31, however Mr. Johnson bluffs. Predictions about Brexit generally assume too much stability in the status quo; Mr. Johnson's slipperiness makes it harder still to predict. Tackling Britain's deep divisions requires depth of character, conviction and principle, none of which its incoming prime minister has ever hinted at possessing.\nIn Mr. Johnson's queasy novel, thankfully his only one to date, a thinly disguised Boris-like politician muses that \"the whole world just seemed to be a complicated joke.\"\nBritain may be about to discover how it feels to be the punch line."}], "Michelle Goldberg": [{"idx": 51, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/13/opinion/sunday/trump-democracy.html", "text": "The despair felt by climate scientists and environmentalists watching helplessly as something precious and irreplaceable is destroyed is sometimes described as \"climate grief.\" Those who pay close attention to the ecological calamity that civilization is inflicting upon itself frequently describe feelings of rage, anxiety and bottomless loss, all of which are amplified by the right's willful denial. The young activist Greta Thunberg, Time Magazine's 2019 Person of the Year, has described falling into a deep depression after grasping the ramifications of climate change and the utter refusal of people in power to rise to the occasion: \"If burning fossil fuels was so bad that it threatened our very existence, how could we just continue like before?\"\nLately, I think I'm experiencing democracy grief. For anyone who was, like me, born after the civil rights movement finally made democracy in America real, liberal democracy has always been part of the climate, as easy to take for granted as clean air or the changing of the seasons. When I contemplate the sort of illiberal oligarchy that would await my children should Donald Trump win another term, the scale of the loss feels so vast that I can barely process it.\nAfter Trump's election, a number of historians and political scientists rushed out with books explaining, as one title put it, \"How Democracies Die.\" In the years since, it's breathtaking how much is dead already. Though the president will almost certainly be impeached for extorting Ukraine to aid his re-election, he is equally certain to be acquitted in the Senate, a tacit confirmation that he is, indeed, above the law. His attorney general is a shameless partisan enforcer. Professional civil servants are purged, replaced by apparatchiks. The courts are filling up with young, hard-right ideologues. One recently confirmed judge, 40-year-old Steven Menashi, has written approvingly of ethnonationalism.\nIn \"How Democracies Die,\" Professors Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt of Harvard describe how, in failing democracies, \"the referees of the democratic game were brought over to the government's side, providing the incumbent with both a shield against constitutional challenges and a powerful \u2014 and 'legal' \u2014 weapon with which to assault its opponents.\" This is happening before our eyes.\nThe entire Trump presidency has been marked, for many of us who are part of the plurality that despises it, by anxiety and anger. But lately I've noticed, and not just in myself, a demoralizing degree of fear, even depression. You can see it online, in the self-protective cynicism of liberals announcing on Twitter that Trump is going to win re-election. In The Washington Post, Michael Gerson, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush and a Never Trump conservative, described his spiritual struggle against feelings of political desperation: \"Sustaining this type of distressed uncertainty for long periods, I can attest, is like putting arsenic in your saltshaker.\"\nI reached out to a number of therapists, who said they're seeing this politically induced misery in their patients. Three years ago, said Karen Starr, a psychologist who practices in Manhattan and on Long Island, some of her patients were \"in a state of alarm,\" but that's changed into \"more of a chronic feeling that's bordering on despair.\" Among those most affected, she said, are the Holocaust survivors she sees. \"It's about this general feeling that the institutions that we rely on to protect us from a dangerous individual might fail,\" she said.\nKimberly Grocher, a psychotherapist who works in both New York and South Florida, and whose clients are primarily women of color, told me that during her sessions, the political situation \"is always in the room. It's always in the room.\" Trump, she said, has made bigotry more open and acceptable, something her patients feel in their daily lives. \"When you're dealing with people of color's mental health, systemic racism is a big part of that,\" she said.\nIn April 2017, I traveled to suburban Atlanta to cover the special election in the Sixth Congressional District. Meeting women there who had been shocked by Trump's election into ceaseless political action made me optimistic for the first time that year. These women were ultimately the reason that the district, once represented by Newt Gingrich, is now held by a Democrat, Lucy McBath. Recently, I got back in touch with a woman I'd met there, an army veteran and mother of three named Katie Landsman. She was in a dark place.\n\"It's like watching someone you love die of a wasting disease,\" she said, speaking of our country. \"Each day, you still have that little hope no matter what happens, you're always going to have that little hope that everything's going to turn out O.K., but every day it seems like we get hit by something else.\" Some mornings, she said, it's hard to get out of bed. \"It doesn't feel like depression,\" she said. \"It really does feel more like grief.\"\nObviously, this is hardly the first time that America has failed to live up to its ideals. But the ideals themselves used to be a nearly universal lodestar. The civil rights movement, and freedom movements that came after it, succeeded because the country could be shamed by the distance between its democratic promises and its reality. That is no longer true.\nDemocrats and anti-Trump Republicans are often incredulous seeing the party of Ronald Reagan allied with Vladimir Putin's Russia, but the truth is, there's no reason they should be in conflict. The enmity between America and Russia was ideological. First it was liberal democracy versus communism. Then it was liberal democracy versus authoritarian kleptocracy.\nBut Trump's political movement is pro-authoritarian and pro-oligarch. It has no interest in preserving pluralism, free and fair elections or any version of the rule of law that applies to the powerful as well as the powerless. It's contemptuous of the notion of America as a lofty idea rather than a blood-and-soil nation. Russia, which has long wanted to prove that liberal democracy is a hypocritical sham, is the natural friend of the Trumpist Republican Party, just as it's an ally and benefactor of the far right Rassemblement National in France and the Lega Nord in Italy.\nThe nemeses of the Trumpist movement are liberals \u2014 in both the classical and American sense of the world \u2014 not America's traditional geopolitical foes. This is something new in our lifetime. Despite right-wing persecution fantasies about Obama, we've never before had a president that treats half the country like enemies, subjecting it to an unending barrage of dehumanization and hostile propaganda. Opponents in a liberal political system share at least some overlapping language. They have some shared values to orient debates. With those things gone, words lose their meaning and political exchange becomes impossible and irrelevant.\nThus we have a total breakdown in epistemological solidarity. In the impeachment committee hearings, Republicans insist with a straight face that Trump was deeply concerned about corruption in Ukraine. Republican Senators like Ted Cruz of Texas, who is smart enough to know better, repeat Russian propaganda accusing Ukraine of interfering in the 2016 election. The Department of Justice's Inspector General report refutes years of Republican deep state conspiracy theories about an F.B.I. plot to subvert Trump's campaign, and it makes no difference whatsoever to the promoters of those theories, who pronounce themselves totally vindicated.\nTo those who recognize the Trump administration's official lies as such, the scale of dishonesty can be destabilizing. It's a psychic tax on the population, who must parse an avalanche of untruths to understand current events. \"What's going on in the government is so extreme, that people who have no history of overwhelming psychological trauma still feel crazed by this,\" said Stephanie Engel, a psychiatrist in Cambridge, Mass., who said Trump comes up \"very frequently\" in her sessions.\nLike several therapists I spoke to, Engel said she's had to rethink how she practices, because she has no clinical distance from the things that are terrifying her patients. \"If we continue to present a facade \u2014 that we know how to manage this ourselves, and we're not worried about our grandchildren, or we're not worried about how we're going to live our lives if he wins the next election \u2014 we're not doing our patients a service,\" she said.\nThis kind of political suffering is uncomfortable to write about, because liberal misery is the raison d'\u00eatre of the MAGA movement. When Trumpists mock their enemies for being \"triggered,\" it's just a quasi-adult version of the playground bully's jeer: \"What are you going to do, cry?\" Anyone who has ever been bullied knows how important it is, at that moment, to choke back tears. In truth there are few bigger snowflakes than the stars of MAGA world; The Trumpist pundit Dan Bongino is currently suing the Daily Beast for $15 million, saying it inflicted \"emotional distress and trauma, insult, anguish,\" for writing that NRATV, the National Rifle Association's now defunct online media arm, had \"dropped\" him when the show he hosted ended. Still, a movement fueled by sadism will delight in admissions that it has caused pain.\nBut despair is worth discussing, because it's something that organizers and Democratic candidates should be addressing head on. Left to fester, it can lead to apathy and withdrawal. Channeled properly, it can fuel an uprising. I was relieved to hear that despite her sometimes overwhelming sense of civic sadness, Landsman's activism hasn't let up. She's been spending a bit less than 20 hours a week on political organizing, and expects to go back to 40 or more after the holidays. \"The only other option is to quit, and accept it, and I'm not ready to go there yet,\" she said. Democracy grief isn't like regular grief. Acceptance isn't how you move on from it. Acceptance is itself a kind of death."}, {"idx": 52, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/opinion/trump-impeachment.html", "text": "At Wednesday's Judiciary Committee hearing on impeachment, the witness called by Republicans, the George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, gave a disingenuous, hackish performance. \nTurley criticized the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump as overly partisan, a concern that didn't seem to trouble him in 1998, when he supported Bill Clinton's impeachment. He argued that Democrats shouldn't accuse Trump of bribery for his Ukraine shakedown unless it meets the statutory definition, even though a 2014 Washington Post op-ed essay by one Jonathan Turley made clear that criminal statutes aren't controlling in the impeachment process. \n\"While there's a high bar for what constitutes grounds for impeachment, an offense does not have to be indictable,\" he wrote then, when he was discussing whether there were grounds for impeaching Barack Obama.\nSo there was no reason for Democrats to take Turley seriously when he argued that the impeachment investigation was too truncated, and that more effort should have been made to coerce testimony from key figures like Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, and John Bolton, his former national security adviser. \nNevertheless, I wish they had. Democrats had little to lose by taking their time excavating the full record of Trump's wrongdoing before turning impeachment over for trial to the Republican-controlled Senate.\nBut that debate became moot on Thursday morning, when Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she'd instructed House investigators to begin drawing up articles of impeachment. Now the question is what those articles will contain. A central point of contention is whether the articles will include Trump's obstruction of justice in Robert Mueller's inquiry into Russia's attack on the 2016 election. It is vitally important that they do.\nIt is understandable that Democrats from swing districts, whose constituents weren't persuaded to back impeachment by the Mueller report, don't want to revisit the murky events of 2016. But to make clear the full gravity of what Trump tried to do in Ukraine, Democrats need to demonstrate that it was part of a pattern.\nAs the Mueller report showed, the Trump campaign welcomed Russian interference in 2016, expecting that \"it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.\" Then Trump repeatedly tried to obstruct the federal government's investigation into what Russia had done. It was only the day after Mueller's congressional testimony that Trump made his demand of Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Part of that demand was that Ukraine help Trump obscure Russia's role in his election by falsely implicating itself. Once the scheme became public, Trump obstructed Congress's investigation into his solicitation of foreign election assistance.\nEither Mueller's findings or the Ukraine \"drug deal,\" as Bolton reportedly called it, would merit impeachment on its own. But the urgency of Democrats' impeachment process \u2014 the subject of much bad-faith caterwauling on the right \u2014 is best justified by Trump's recidivism. Impeachment isn't just about holding Trump accountable for a discrete scandal. It's about trying, against the odds, to stop an ongoing campaign to subvert the 2020 election, one that is building on tactics from 2016.\nIndeed, even as the Judiciary Committee discussed impeachment, Giuliani was in Ukraine seeking meetings with corrupt former prosecutors who, he apparently hoped, would undercut the Democrats' case. A day before that, Giuliani had been in Budapest where he met with another disgraced former Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, as well as with Andrii V. Artemenko, a pro-Russian former member of Ukraine's Parliament.\nArtemenko's name might be familiar to those who've followed Trump's Russia scandal closely. He was the one who reportedly gave Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer, a Russia-friendly \"peace plan\" for Russia and Ukraine, which Cohen transmitted to Michael Flynn, then Trump's national security adviser. Artemenko, The New York Times reported in 2017, \"sees himself as a Trump-style leader of a future Ukraine.\" He'd claimed to have evidence of corruption by Ukraine's president at the time, Petro Poroshenko, a pro-Western figure he was trying to oust. \"Mr. Artemenko said he had received encouragement for his plans from top aides\" to President Vladimir Putin of Russia, The Times said.\nTo understand the sociopathic shamelessness of Giuliani seeking Artemenko's help with Trump's current domestic political problems, you have to understand how the Russia scandal and the Ukraine scandal intersect.\nGiven America's political polarization, public opinion on impeachment is unlikely to move much no matter what Democrats do. Nevertheless, they'd be mad to let centrist trepidation stop them from making the strongest possible case for Trump's removal. Doing that requires a willingness to put Trump's Ukraine corruption in context. \nDemocrats have only one chance to impeach the most corrupt and disloyal president in American history. They say they're rushing through it because it can't wait. They have a duty to explain not just why Trump betrayed America when he sought to extort election help from Ukraine, but how we know that he'll nearly certainly try the same thing again."}, {"idx": 53, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/02/opinion/queen-slim-slave-play.html", "text": "I left a recent matinee of \"Queen & Slim,\" the mesmerizing new outlaw romance directed by Melina Matsoukas, astonished on two levels. The film itself kept me rapt; I cried through the end and left the theater with the dazed, disoriented feeling you get when a movie makes you momentarily forget everything else in your life. But as amazed as I was by the experience of watching the film, I was equally amazed that it got made at all.\n\"Queen & Slim\" is about a black man and a black woman \u2014 we don't learn their real names until the very end \u2014 who, following a desultory first date, get caught in a traffic stop that goes hideously wrong. The policeman who pulls them over becomes needlessly aggressive, and when Queen, a defense attorney, tries to record him with her phone, he shoots her. In the scuffle that follows, the cop is killed, and the couple, their fates suddenly soldered together, go on the run.\nFrom the title on, the film invites comparisons to Hollywood classics like \"Bonnie and Clyde\" and, especially, \"Thelma & Louise.\" (It can't be a coincidence that the fugitives in \"Queen & Slim,\" like those in \"Thelma & Louise,\" spend much of the film in a flashy vintage turquoise car.) Producing those earlier movies, both subversive in different ways, was famously difficult. A studio executive reportedly complained about the \"Thelma & Louise\" screenplay, \"Two bitches in a car. I don't get it.\"\nI'd have guessed that the path for \"Queen & Slim\" \u2014 a film steeped in the politics of Black Lives Matter and helmed by a first-time director who is a woman of color \u2014 would have been even more difficult.\nBut I'd have guessed wrong. Speaking to Variety, the producer and screenwriter Lena Waithe made working with Universal Pictures seem like an artist's dream. \"They just paid for the movie and supported us, and let us do our thing, which was incredible,\" she said.\nA common lament of our time is that our culture has become too safe, and that no one can say anything provocative anymore. \"Everyone fears the wrath of the Twitter mob and the social justice warriors and the P.C. police,\" Bill Maher told The New York Times Magazine in September. There is certainly something to this \u2014 I know that while I try to write without concern for social media, it still inhibits me. \nBut it's equally true that many artists, performers and thinkers have more freedom to tell transgressive stories than ever before. We don't have more cultural taboos than we used to \u2014 far from it. We just have more contention over who should have the power to create and enforce them.\nOne of the most celebrated works on Broadway right now, \"Slave Play,\" is also the most shocking piece of theater I've ever seen. It's built around an absurdist conceit. Three interracial couples attend a retreat at a former plantation. There, they undergo something called \"antebellum sexual performance therapy,\" which basically means using slavery-themed sadomasochism scenarios to help the black partners work through racial trauma.\nThough \"Slave Play,\" which was written and directed by queer black men, takes a lot of the assumptions of what might be called social justice culture for granted, it's nevertheless promiscuous in its provocations. (A central conflict revolves around a black woman furious at her white husband's refusal to racially degrade her during sex.) When it premiered Off Broadway last year, it attracted outrage, including a Change.org petition calling for its cancellation on account of \"anti-black sentiment.\" \nOn Friday, a white woman started shouting during a post-show Q. and A. because she was angry about the play's depiction of white people. Such responses, however, haven't stopped \"Slave Play\" from becoming a sensation. They've probably made it more of one.\nOf course, white artists and performers aggrieved by political correctness may not be comforted that artists of color are able to create daring work. They might find more consolation in the resurrection of Louis C.K.\n One of the men ostensibly felled by the #MeToo movement, Louis C.K.'s career was derailed for about nine months after news broke of his sexual misconduct with women in his industry. Now performing again, he was recently in the news for making a Holocaust joke in Israel. The crowd reportedly loved it, even if Twitter didn't. He'll be on tour in America soon; most of the dates are sold out.\nWhat men like Louis C.K. or Maher have lost isn't the right to offend, or to make a living, but their place on the cultural cutting edge. That kind of loss feels real; the process of going from being ahead of your time to behind it is a painful one. But the forces that leave some artists and performers feeling newly constrained have liberated others to take risks. Writing about \"Queen & Slim\" in The New Yorker, Jelani Cobb said, \"This is a film that stands as strong a chance of being hailed and lauded as it does of being denounced and picketed.\" \nTwitter rage can be scary, but surely it requires at least as much courage for a Hollywood movie to take on the police."}, {"idx": 54, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/25/opinion/trump-fusion-gps-book.html", "text": "There are two very big lies that Donald Trump and his sycophants have used, through aggressive, bombastic repetition, to shape the public debate about impeachment, and about Trump's legitimacy more broadly.\nThe first big lie is that \"the people\" elected Trump, and that the constitutional provision of impeachment would invalidate their choice. In fact, Trump is president only because a constitutional provision invalidated the choice of the American people. Trump lost the popular vote and might have lost the Electoral College without Russian interference, and yet many Democrats and pundits have been bullied into accepting the fiction that he has democratic, and not just constitutional, legitimacy.\nThe second big lie is that Russia didn't help elect Trump, and that the president has been absolved of collusion. It's true that the report by Robert Mueller, the former special counsel, did not find enough evidence to prove a criminal conspiracy between Trump's campaign and Russian state actors. But the Mueller report found abundant evidence that the campaign sought Russian help, benefited from that help and obstructed the F.B.I. investigation into Russian actions. His investigation resulted in felony convictions for Trump's former campaign chairman, deputy campaign chairman, personal lawyer, first national security adviser, and longtime political adviser, among others.\nHad public life in America not been completely deformed by blizzards of official lies, right-wing propaganda and the immovable wall of Republican bad faith, the Mueller report would have ended Trump's minoritarian presidency. Instead, something utterly perverse happened. Democrats, deflated by the Mueller report's anticlimactic rollout, decided to move on rather than keep the focus on Trump's world-historic treachery. Republicans, meanwhile, started screaming about a \"Russia hoax\" ostensibly perpetrated on their dear leader. Among them was the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, who in 2016 was surreptitiously recorded telling his congressional colleagues that he thinks President Vladimir Putin of Russia pays Trump. \"Swear to God,\" he said at the time.\nThis brings us to where we are now. Democrats understand that the Ukraine scandal is an outgrowth of the Russia scandal \u2014 as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last month, with Trump, \"all roads seem to lead to Putin.\" Yet they've made the political calculation that reopening the broader story of how Trump has been compromised by Russia is a political loser.\nIn her closed-door deposition last month, the former White House Russia expert Fiona Hill suggested that Putin may have targeted Trump well before he entered politics. Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, tried to clarify: \"Why do you believe that Putin was targeting Donald Trump from his days as a businessman?\" Hill responded, \"Because that's exactly what President Putin and others were doing.\" No one followed up on this when Hill testified publicly.\nRather, it's Republicans, with their heroic capacity for shamelessness, who want to talk about Russia. They've set out to investigate the investigators, trying to make efforts to uncover the truth about Trump's Russia connections, rather than the connections themselves, into a scandal. And now they're trying to expand their big lie about Russia to cover Ukraine as well. The president, McCarthy said last month, \"was trying to get to the bottom, just as every American would want to know, why did we have this Russia hoax that actually started within Ukraine.\"\nBecause Republicans have been so successful in shrouding the origins of the Russia investigation in a miasma of misinformation, I hope some talented filmmaker makes a movie out of the new book by Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch, \"Crime in Progress: Inside the Steele Dossier and the Fusion GPS Investigation of Donald Trump.\" Simpson and Fritsch are the co-founders of Fusion GPS, the research firm that investigated Trump during the 2016 campaign, first for the conservative Washington Free Beacon, and then for a lawyer for the Hillary Clinton campaign. It was Fusion GPS that hired the British ex-spy Christopher Steele to look into Trump's Russia connections, and it sits at the center of countless pro-Trump conspiracy theories. When Republicans controlled the House, Fritsch told me on Monday, \"The only bank records that were subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee were ours.\"\n\"Crime in Progress\" is the best procedural yet written about the discovery of Trump's Russia ties. It demolishes a number of right-wing talking points, including the claim that the Steele dossier formed the basis of the F.B.I.'s counterintelligence inquiry into Trump. (The Justice Department inspector general's report on the origins of the Russia investigation will reportedly disprove this canard once and for all.) But it also makes plain what many Republicans knew before the 2016 election, even if they've now pretended to forget it. For years, Trump was financially entangled with organized crime as well as with Kremlin-friendly oligarchs, and by keeping those entanglements secret, he gave Putin leverage over him from the moment he took office.\nWrite Simpson and Fritsch, \"In the end, the Mueller probe sidestepped the question that so unnerved Fusion GPS and Christopher Steele in the summer of 2016: Was the president of the United States under the influence of a foreign adversary?\" Republicans have used all the power at their command to defame people who've asked this question. Perhaps that's because otherwise they'd have to take seriously all the evidence that the answer is yes."}, {"idx": 55, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/opinion/gordon-sondland-impeachment-hearings.html", "text": "Over the first three days of testimony in the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump, Republicans have tried out a number of defenses. After the Wednesday testimony of Gordon Sondland, Trump's ambassador to the European Union, almost all of them have been incinerated.\nThroughout the proceedings, Devin Nunes, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, has glowered, sneered and repeated some of the same conspiracy theories that Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, wanted Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to substantiate.\nRepresentative Jim Jordan, the Republican recently added to the Intelligence Committee because he's seen as an effective advocate for Trump, has argued that Trump was genuinely concerned about corruption in Ukraine, and was induced to release frozen aid after Ukraine's Parliament passed reform measures.\nOthers have repeated the refrain of \"no quid pro quo.\" Some have tried to dismiss the claims against Trump as mere hearsay. A few have suggested that Sondland and Giuliani were working on their own.\nNunes's already phantasmagorical case was further undermined on Tuesday, when Republicans called Kurt Volker, Trump's former special envoy for Ukraine, to testify. Volker called allegations that, as vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine for personal reasons \"self-serving and not credible\" and accused Giuliani of spreading a \"conspiracy theory.\"\nMost other defenses of Trump were demolished by Sondland's explosive testimony on Wednesday. In recent days, there have been signs that Sondland was being set up as a fall guy in the Ukraine scandal. Testifying Tuesday, another Republican witness, Tim Morrison, until recently the top Russia expert on the National Security Council, referred to the \"Gordon problem,\" suggesting he was an oft-ignored nuisance. But Sondland seems to have decided that he would not go easily under the proverbial bus.\nIn his opening statement, Sondland described how Giuliani wanted the Ukrainians to investigate an imagined Ukrainian role in hacking the Democratic National Committee in 2016, and Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company on whose board Biden's son served. \"Mr. Giuliani's requests were a quid pro quo for arranging a White House visit for President Zelensky,\" he said. \"Mr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a public statement announcing investigations of the 2016 election/D.N.C. server and Burisma. Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the president of the United States, and we knew that these investigations were important to the president.\" With that, Sondland confirmed the heart of the Democrats' case for impeachment.\nSondland said he communicated to a leading Ukrainian official that \"the resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine took some kind of action on the public statement that we had been discussing for many weeks.\" He testified that he told Vice President Mike Pence that he believed the aid was being held up pending investigations, and Pence just nodded. (Pence's chief of staff denied this.) Sondland didn't substantially dispute the closed-door testimony of David Holmes, a senior U.S. Embassy official in Ukraine, who said he overheard a call to Trump that Sondland made on his cellphone. According to Holmes, on the call, made the day after the July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Zelensky for a \"favor,\" Trump asked Sondland if the Ukrainians were in fact going to pursue investigations. Sondland replied that they'd do whatever the president wanted.\nAfter the call, Holmes testified, Sondland told him that Trump \"did not give a [expletive] about Ukraine,\" and cared only about what Sondland called \"big stuff\" that benefits the president. About that call, Sondland testified, \"I would have been more surprised if President Trump had not mentioned investigations, particularly given what we were hearing from Mr. Giuliani.\"\nFurther, Sondland testified that Trump didn't necessarily care about investigations per se, only the public announcement of investigations. Zelensky \"had to announce the investigations, he didn't actually have to do them,\" he said. The public announcement, of course, would be sufficient to give Trump material to defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's help in getting Trump elected in the first place.\nSpeaking of Russia's role in 2016: A few Republicans have tried to massage Trump's claims of Ukrainian election interference to make them sound marginally less insane. At Wednesday's hearing, Nunes accused Ukraine of meddling in America's election largely through public statements by Ukrainian officials. Among these statements was a 2016 op-ed essay by Valeriy Chaly, then the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, objecting to Trump's statement that as president he'd consider recognizing Russian-occupied Crimea as Russian, rather than Ukrainian, territory.\nLeave aside that there is nothing illicit about public officials expressing their opinions about matters of urgent concern to their own countries. Sondland's testimony made it plain that such public comments are not what Trump had in mind in calling for investigations into what Ukraine did in 2016. Trump wanted an inquiry into the conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the D.N.C., which is why Sondland repeatedly spoke about proposed investigations involving the \"D.N.C. server.\" He wanted Ukraine's help exonerating Russia for its attack on America.\nSondland is not a wholly reliable witness; his insistence that he was ignorant of the connection between Burisma and the Bidens when he pressed Ukraine for investigations is hardly credible. (Volker made the same preposterous claim on Tuesday \u2014 both men were likely trying to distance themselves from one of the ugliest aspects of Trump's shakedown.) Republicans will likely cling to the fact that Sondland said he never heard directly from Trump about a linkage between security aid to Ukraine and investigations; Sondland said he put it together because, as he repeated several times, \"two plus two equals four.\"\nUnfortunately for Republicans, Mick Mulvaney, who was reportedly directed by Trump to put the hold on Ukraine aid, has already said, on television, that the aid was frozen as part of a quid pro quo for investigations. (Mulvaney, the White House's acting chief of staff and head of the Office of Management and Budget, later denied that he said this, despite the clear public record.) Much of the Republican case, going forward, is likely to depend on pretending that this confession doesn't exist.\n\"This obviously has been one of those bombshell days,\" Ken Starr, the former special prosecutor who investigated Bill Clinton, said on Fox News after Sondland's morning testimony. I suspect that by the time anyone reads this, Republicans will have cooked up talking points pretending that nothing Sondland said actually matters. \nBut at this point, all they can do is obfuscate. About the push for investigations, Sondland said, \"Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret.\" This administration is rotten to the core and fundamentally disloyal to the country it purports to serve. So is every politician who still tries to explain its corruption away."}, {"idx": 56, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/opinion/stephen-miller-white-nationalism.html", "text": "In August 2018, Darren Beattie, a White House speechwriter and policy aide, was fired after CNN revealed that he'd spoken at a 2016 conference alongside several white nationalists, including contributors to the website VDARE. Later that month, Ian M. Smith, a policy analyst working on immigration at the Department of Homeland Security, resigned after The Atlantic obtained leaked emails linking him to white nationalists.\nWe're about to find out how far the already impossibly low standards to which we hold the Trump administration have fallen since then. Last week, the Southern Poverty Law Center published evidence of the white nationalism of Stephen Miller, President Trump's senior immigration adviser. The S.P.L.C. obtained more than 900 emails from 2015 and 2016 that Miller, who was then an aide to Senator Jeff Sessions, sent to editors at the far-right website Breitbart to shape its coverage of race and immigration. The group got the emails from Katie McHugh, a former Breitbart editor who, after being fired for anti-Muslim tweets, moved even further right before renouncing racism. The emails show that Miller was steeped in white nationalism before he joined the White House, where he's had the opportunity to put his racist views into practice.\nMcHugh told the S.P.L.C. that her bosses introduced her to Miller so that he could help guide the site's reporting. Miller forwarded her articles from sites like VDARE \u2014 named for Virginia Dare, the first English child born in North America \u2014 and Alex Jones's Infowars. Miller sent McHugh information about \"immigrant crime\" and offered her talking points on defending Confederate iconography in the wake of the white nationalist Dylann Roof's massacre of black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C.\nIn one email, Miller recommended that Breitbart draw parallels between Pope Francis' 2015 speech before Congress, in which he called on America to welcome immigrants, and the wildly racist 1973 novel \"The Camp of the Saints,\" in which weak-minded leftists allow soulless brown hordes to conquer the white world. Breitbart published just such a piece a few weeks later, quoting the novel's disparagement of the decadent West's aversion to genocide: \"With France the Enlightened glad to grovel on her knees, no government now will dare sign its name to the genocidal deed.\"\nThe question now is whether any of this can be made to matter. Miller's aversion to nonwhite immigrants, after all, is hardly a secret \u2014 it's why he has his job in the first place. He's been pushing white nationalist policies for three years, championing the Muslim ban and the sadistic policy of family separation and encouraging Trump to slash refugee admissions. In an email to McHugh, Miller argued against Mexican hurricane victims receiving temporary protected status, a provision protecting people displaced by natural disasters and wars from deportation. (\"T.P.S. is everything,\" he wrote.) Now he's a leading figure in an administration that has tried to yank T.P.S. from more than 300,000 people. Meanwhile, he reportedly worked on a plan with Gordon Sondland, Trump's hackish ambassador to the European Union, to encourage more immigration from Europe. The Washington Post reported that some of his own co-workers believe he holds racist views, though he insisted otherwise.\nSo it's not a shock to learn about the roots of Miller's ideology. There's a difference, however, between knowing something and proving it. \"The evidence is incontrovertible,\" Jonathan Greenblatt, head of the Anti-Defamation League, told me of Miller's white nationalist associations. \"It's no longer speculation. It's now been substantiated.\" He said bluntly: \"Stephen Miller must resign.\"\nEarlier this year, when Representative Ilhan Omar called Miller a white nationalist, powerful figures on the right slammed her as an anti-Semite because Miller is Jewish. A White House official tried to reprise this defense last week, but no one is buying it.\nThough the revelations about Miller aren't surprising, it's important that they not be swept away by the torrent of other news, lest we admit that even the degraded standards of 2018 no longer apply. \"This is a smoking gun,\" said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has been leading the call for Miller's resignation in Congress, adding, \"We didn't know this, because if we did, we would have demanded his resignation much earlier, and in a much more forceful way.\"\nTrump is, of course, unlikely to jettison his xenophobic homunculus. \"Stephen is not going anywhere,\" a senior White House official told The Daily Beast last week. \"The president has his back.\" But the pressure on Trump, and, perhaps more important, on his supporters in Congress, is only going to build.\nMany elected Republicans justify their fealty to Trump by denying the white nationalist character of his administration. When the president does things that make that impossible \u2014 say, by praising racist marchers in Charlottesville or telling congresswomen of color to go back to their countries \u2014 it can force members of his party to either condemn him or condone racism.\nOn Monday, a coalition of civil rights organizations including the ADL, the N.A.A.C.P. and United We Dream sent a letter to the White House demanding Miller's removal, writing, \"Supporters of white supremacists and neo-Nazis should not be allowed to serve at any level of government.\" Ocasio-Cortez sees a possibility for protests. \"It's really just a matter of sticking to it and not allowing this to fall out of the media cycle,\" she said. \"This is something that I personally am committed to. This is a really big deal.\" I hope she's right. If she's not, it will show us how much hate we've learned to tolerate."}, {"idx": 57, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/opinion/trump-impeachment-hearings.html", "text": "There was a bleak symmetry to the momentous events of this week.\nOn Wednesday, during the first day of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump, Bill Taylor and George Kent, two State Department officials of impeccable credentials, explained how the president used foreign aid and the promise of a White House meeting to try to extort a vulnerable ally for help with his re-election. \nWithholding security assistance from Ukraine \"for no good reason other than help with a political campaign made no sense,\" said Taylor, America's top diplomat in that country. \"It was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do. It was illogical. It could not be explained. It was crazy.\" The hearing made it clear that Trump subverted foreign policy in order to cheat in the 2020 campaign.\nWednesday was also the day of closing arguments in the trial of Roger Stone, the longtime Trump associate charged with making false statements to Congress, witness tampering and obstruction of justice in Congress's investigation into Russian election interference. \nDuring the trial, the former Trump campaign chief executive Steve Bannon testified that he regarded Stone as the campaign's \"access point\" to WikiLeaks, which published thousands of Democratic National Committee emails that were hacked by Russia. The Former Trump campaign staffer Rick Gates testified that Trump spoke directly to Stone about WikiLeaks' plans. Trump, in written testimony to the special counsel Robert Mueller, said he remembered no such conversation. Stone seems to have exaggerated his WikiLeaks' connections, but the trial made it clear that the Trump campaign tried hard to take advantage of Russian cybercrimes in the 2016 election, and that Trump lied about it.\nAfter the impeachment hearing, some in the media appeared to yawn. Two Reuters reporters pronounced the proceedings \"consequential, but dull,\" writing, \"Unlike the best reality TV shows \u2014 not to mention the Trump presidency itself \u2014 fireworks and explosive moments were scarce.\" An NBC News analysis concluded that the hearing \"felt more like the dress rehearsal for a serious one-act play than the opening night of a hit Broadway musical.\"\nIt's certainly true that there were few new revelations on Wednesday, since transcripts of the witnesses' closed-door testimony had already been released. But if the facts at hand have not shaken the country to its core, that's not the fault of Democrats on the Intelligence Committee. The responsibility lies with us all for letting this lawless, kleptocratic presidency become normalized.\nLike addicts to the world's most unpleasant drug, our political class seems to require ever-greater jolts to feel anything at all. A month ago, some Republican senators were briefly roused from their submissive torpor by Trump's cavalier decision to greenlight a Turkish attack on America's Kurdish allies in Syria. Lindsey Graham, usually an obsequious Trump lackey, said that if the president didn't change course, he was prepared to become Trump's \"worst nightmare.\" \nTrump did not change course on protecting the Kurds, and on Wednesday he licked the boots of Turkey's dictatorial president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, during an Oval Office meeting. But rather than rebelling, Graham fell in line. After the meeting, as if reveling in his own abasement, he decided to side with Erdogan and block a congressional resolution recognizing the Ottoman Empire's Armenian genocide, a mass atrocity that Turkey furiously denies.\nSo it's true: The Trumpian treachery revealed at the hearing on Wednesday will not move immovable Republicans. Last month Graham told Axios that there were circumstances in which he might support impeachment. \"If you could show me that, you know, Trump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo, outside the phone call, that would be very disturbing,\" he said. Now that there is abundant evidence of just such a quid pro quo, Graham has moved the goal posts, saying that the inquiry is \"invalid\" unless the whistle-blower who revealed Trump's Ukraine scheme is outed.\nBut it is a monumental mistake to allow people who will accept anything from Trump to set our standards for acceptable public behavior. By any normal metric, this week's news \u2014 the impeachment hearing, the Stone trial, the mortifying Erdogan meeting, not to mention new revelations of the senior Trump adviser Stephen Miller's white nationalism \u2014 was sensational and historic. The fact that Republicans are insisting otherwise is a sign of the depths of our political crisis. Each one of us must choose whether to treat their mulish disloyalty to their fellow citizens as a given, worthy only of shrugs, or as a shocking affront that demands redoubled political action.\nFaced with evidence of Trump's crimes, a significant part of the right is trying to convince Americans that the president has been set up by the Jewish philanthropist George Soros. The lurid McCarthyite fantasy that Soros controls American diplomats has been a theme in this scandal from the beginning \u2014 Rudy Giuliani has pushed the idea repeatedly. \nNow the claims are getting louder. On Wednesday night Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing, two attorneys who've served as conduits between Giuliani and corrupt Ukrainian interests, appeared on Lou Dobbs's Fox Business show, where diGenova said, \"There's no doubt that George Soros controls a very large part of the career foreign service of the United States State Department.\" On Thursday, the white nationalist Representative Steve King tweeted out a picture of Soros's son, claiming, absurdly, that he was the whistle-blower. (King later deleted it.)\nThese are the sort of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories that deform public life in squalid second-rate oligarchies like Russia and Hungary. In three short years, Republicans have allowed our country to sink to that level \u2014 indeed, to sink below it, since foreign authoritarians find it easy to manipulate our president, and scarcely seem to regard him as their equal.\nThere is nothing Democrats can do to make their Republican colleagues side with upstanding patriots like Taylor and Kent \u2014 who embody the virtues conservatives once venerated \u2014 over their dear leader and the mad rantings of his worshipers. All they can do is make plain the choice America faces between hewing to ideals that everyone in public life once at least pretended to revere, or consenting to their defilement. Either Americans will reclaim their birthright and become a liberal democracy again, or not. It's up to all of us to decide how much we care about being entertained in the process."}, {"idx": 58, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/opinion/republicans-trump-impeachment-hearings.html", "text": "On Friday, House investigators released the transcript of the former National Security Council official Fiona Hill's testimony from last month. It showed a Republican staff member trying and failing to get Hill to concede that there might be some validity to the conspiracy theories underlying Donald Trump's demands of President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.\n\"Are you familiar with the, you know, the allegation about Serhiy Leshchenko?\" asked the Republican aide, Steve Castor. He added, \"You know, relating to publicizing Manafort's role in the Ukraine?\"\nLeshchenko, whom I interviewed in October, is a former member of Parliament in Ukraine and probably the most famous investigative journalist in the country. He helped expose the so-called black ledger that listed $12.7 million in secret payments to Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, from his client Viktor Yanukovych, the wildly corrupt Russian-aligned oligarch who ruled Ukraine until 2014. Manafort is in federal prison in part for failing to disclose or pay taxes on the millions he sucked out of Ukraine. Nevertheless, to make Trump's demands of Zelensky seem just and rational, some Republicans have started painting Manafort as the victim of Leshchenko's plotting.\nHill, a Russia expert and co-author of a psychological study of Vladimir Putin, tried to shut down this line of questioning. \"The Ukrainian government did not interfere in the U.S. election,\" she said, adding, \"The Ukrainian Special Services also did not interfere in our election.\" As the Republican questions continued, Hill seems to have grown almost indignant. \"I'm really worried about these conspiracy theories, and I'm worried that all of you are going to go down a rabbit hole, you know, looking for things that are not going to be at all helpful to the American people or to our future election in 2020,\" she said.\nShe is right to be concerned. This week, as part of its impeachment inquiry, the House begins public hearings into Trump's attempt to extort Ukraine's president into starting bogus investigations to benefit Trump politically. Republicans have telegraphed several possible defenses of the president. \nThe Washington Post reported that House Republicans may try to throw the hapless Trump lackeys Rudy Giuliani, Mick Mulvaney and Gordon Sondland under the bus, suggesting they \"could have acted on their own to influence Ukraine policy.\" Other Republicans have settled on calling Trump's actions \"inappropriate\" but not impeachable. But the House Republicans who are actually involved in the hearings seem set to go all in on the fantasy of Ukrainian election interference. To exonerate Trump, they are ready to help cover for Russia.\nOn Saturday, Devin Nunes, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, sent the committee's chairman, Adam Schiff, a list of people Republicans want to call to testify. To understand the significance of some of the names, you'd have to plunge into the very rabbit holes Hill warned of. Luckily, Nunes made his intention clear, writing of Trump's \"documented belief that the Ukrainian government meddled in the 2016 election,\" which \"forms the basis for a reasonable desire for Ukraine to investigate the circumstances surrounding the election.\"\nThe conspiracy theories that undergird the president's \"documented belief\" aren't really coherent, but they don't have to be to serve their purpose, which is sowing confusion about the well-established fact that Russia assisted Trump's campaign. They posit not just that Manafort was set up, but also that Democrats worked with Ukraine to frame Russia for hacking Democrats' emails, a dastardly Democratic plot that led to Trump's election. Naturally, George Soros, perennial scapegoat for the far right, is also involved.\n\"George Soros was behind it. George Soros's company was funding it,\" Giuliani said on ABC in September, spinning tales of Hillary Clinton's collusion with Ukraine. Speaking to The Post, Giuliani accused Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, of \"working for Soros.\" Indeed, Hill in her testimony suggested that a sort of Infowars-era McCarthyism has been loosed on the national security bureaucracy, with \"frankly an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory about George Soros\" used to \"target nonpartisan career officials, and also some political appointees as well.\"\nSome of these lies seem to have originated in Russia; documents from the Mueller investigation recently obtained by BuzzFeed News show that Manafort was blaming Ukraine for the Democratic National Committee hack back in 2016, a story he apparently got from one of his associates, a former Russian intelligence officer named Konstantin Kilimnik. (Hill testified that she'd encountered Kilimnik in a previous job, and \"all of my staff thought he was a Russian spy.\")\nA few of Trump's more responsible aides have reportedly tried to disabuse him of Ukraine conspiracy theories, to no avail. Instead it appears that House Republicans, out of slavish fealty to the president, are going to use high-profile hearings to amplify them.\nIn her testimony, Hill seemed to warn Republicans off their current path. She mentioned the report issued last month by the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee about how Russia used online propaganda to boost Trump in 2016. \"If we have people running around chasing rabbit holes because Rudy Giuliani or others have been feeding information to The Hill, Politico, we are not going to be prepared as a country to push back on this again,\" she said. \"The Russians thrive on misinformation and disinformation.\" Unfortunately, so do Trump's defenders."}, {"idx": 59, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/opinion/2020-election-democrats.html", "text": "Last Saturday I was at a restaurant with my daughter when I ran into a friend of a friend. With little preamble she said, her voice choked with panic, \"He's going to win again.\" She told me, I think half-facetiously, that she was finding it hard to socialize, because she could scarcely talk about anything but her horror of Donald Trump and her suppurating fear that he could be re-elected.\nPundits sometimes address Democratic primary voters as if they were complacent about the chances of another Trump term and need a harsh dose of reality. The primary campaign, New York magazine's Jonathan Chait wrote recently, \"has proceeded in blissful unawareness of the extremely high chance that Trump will win again.\" But if there are Democrats out there who think beating Trump is going to be easy, I've yet to meet them. I'm deeply scared, and so are most progressives I speak to.\nAccording to the polls we're not alone; in one recent survey, 67 percent of Democrats said they feel anxious about the election. Reports from Iowa suggest that Democratic primary voters, desperate to find a silver bullet against Trump, are wracked with indecision. \"Nobody knows what to do,\" one member of a county Democratic committee told The Associated Press. \"They're all afraid.\"\nObviously, fear makes sense, given the stakes of this election. But too much of it can be demoralizing, even disabling. \"Democrats are particularly prone to toggling between overconfident jubilance and terrified paralysis,\" said Ben Wikler, who was elected Wisconsin Democratic Party chair in June after years with the progressive organizing group MoveOn.\nPart of the problem is that it's not clear exactly what Democrats who abhor Trump should be doing right now. Immediately after the 2016 election, there was the Women's March, then the airport protests, then the health care town halls. Democrats mobilized for a series of special elections and then for the 2018 midterms. That mobilization is still happening \u2014 it's why Democrats just won big victories in Virginia and, it appears, Kentucky. But at the moment, a lot of Democratic political energy is being spent on the primary, an inevitably divisive process that leaves many people second-guessing themselves.\nThose shaken by the possibility of a second Trump term, however, can take concrete steps to make that prospect less likely, even if they don't live in swing states. Doing so isn't only useful \u2014 it's therapeutic. \"The best answer to despair is recognizing that you're not helpless,\" said Ezra Levin, co-founder of the progressive group Indivisible and co-author of the new book \"We Are Indivisible: A Blueprint for Democracy After Trump.\"\nWhere to start? Well, in Wisconsin, said Wikler, the general election is already underway. Just this past weekend, volunteers braved the snow to knock on 54,000 doors, looking to identify voters who might be sympathetic to Democrats but who aren't on Democratic voter lists. Until recently, said Wikler, those lists didn't include a single person in the town of Seymour, population 3,459. But canvassers there found enough people fired up about beating Trump to form their own local group.\nAt this point, Wisconsin Democrats don't need outsiders to fly in and knock on doors. What they do need are virtual volunteers to call and text reminders to local canvassers. And, of course, they need money. Once I learned that individuals can donate $10,000 to each of the state Democratic parties, I wondered why I'm not being invited to fund-raisers to rebuild the blue wall every weekend.\n\"As much as people are obsessing over the primary, the work of donating and volunteering and showing up and getting involved \u2014 especially in state parties in battleground states \u2014 is essential now,\" said Wikler. \"People often make panic donations in the last couple of weeks of a campaign. Certainly those donations are welcome, but at the end of a campaign all you can do is buy some more ads. If you make the panic donation a year out, it means that state parties and outside groups can hire more field organizers to train more volunteers to be able to reach out to more neighbors who might never get onto the get-out-the-vote lists unless the conversation starts months and months in advance.\"\nThere are also plenty of things that volunteers can do outside the Democratic Party structure. Andrew Gillum, who narrowly lost the Florida governor's race last year, is leading a huge voter registration drive in that crucial state. Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost the race for Georgia governor, has founded a group, Fair Fight 2020, to register and mobilize voters and tackle voter suppression.\nIndivisible is working on driving more than a million calls to Republican senators who are up for re-election next year demanding a fair and open impeachment trial. \"The goal is not, if you're in Brooklyn, call into Iowa, because Joni Ernst doesn't care what you think,\" said Levin, referring to Iowa's junior senator. Instead, Indivisible has created a tool that allows members to call progressives in states like Iowa, talk to them about impeachment, and then patch them through to their senators' offices. In Oregon, he said, some people have been hosting calling parties.\nLevin reminded me that in 2017, Democrats' chances of winning the House seemed bleak, given the effect of gerrymandering. \"In early 2017 we got laughed at when we said we could take the House,\" he said. The blue wave of 2018 wasn't preordained \u2014 people built it. They're building another. The only cure for worrying about whether it will be big enough is to help."}, {"idx": 60, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/opinion/trump-ukraine.html", "text": "Kenneth McCallion is a New York lawyer who once represented former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko of Ukraine. A few years ago, he brought a civil racketeering lawsuit on her behalf against some now familiar figures like Paul Manafort and the Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry Firtash. He knows a lot about corruption in Ukraine, and he said that earlier this year F.B.I. counterintelligence investigators approached him for information about Rudy Giuliani's Ukrainian activities.\nBy then, McCallion had already been hearing strange things about what Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, whom we now know as Giuliani's close associates, were doing in Ukraine.\n Parnas and Fruman, both American citizens born in the former Soviet Union, aren't ordinary political operatives. Parnas has long been a low-level grifter. Fruman owns an Odessa beach club called Mafia Rave, and a joint investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and BuzzFeed News found ties between him and an Odessa organized crime figure named Volodymyr Galanternik, known as \"Light Bulb.\"\nThe duo first appeared on the American political scene in 2015 as enthusiastic supporters of Donald Trump. They became big-dollar donors to a number of Republicans; their Instagram accounts would soon fill up with photos of party elites. Then, this year, McCallion learned they were poking around Ukrainian politics, where they were spreading conspiracy theories that Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in America's election in 2016.\n\"All of a sudden they started going around Ukraine telling anybody who would listen, particularly with the government, that they have been advised by a high-level, mysterious unnamed source, that in fact the D.N.C. servers had been hidden in Ukraine, that Russia was not the origin,\" he told me. This claim, which echoed Russian propaganda, contradicts the findings of the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee. Nevertheless, it soon came to shape American foreign policy.\nThe heart of the Ukraine scandal, for which Trump will almost certainly be impeached, is simple. Trump used congressionally appropriated aid to Ukraine, as well as the promise of a White House visit, to try to extort Ukraine's president to announce investigations that would benefit Trump politically.\nBut there's a broader story that's still murky, because in this scandal Trump is both the perpetrator and the mark. Trump used the power of his office to try to force Ukraine to substantiate conspiracy theories. But the president was fed those conspiracy theories by people with their own agendas, who surely understood that he is insecure about Russia's role in his election, and he will believe whatever serves his ego in the moment. The main reason Trump should be removed from office is that he has subverted American foreign policy for corrupt personal ends. But this scandal is the latest reminder of how easy sinister forces find it to pull his strings.\nOn Saturday, BuzzFeed News obtained previously secret documents from Robert Mueller's investigation via Freedom of Information Act lawsuits. The documents showed that Manafort, convicted felon and Trump's former campaign chairman, was pushing the story that Ukraine was to blame for hacking the D.N.C. as far back as 2016. Manafort seems to have picked up that narrative from his associate Konstantin Kilimnik, a former Russian intelligence officer who, according to federal prosecutors, \"has ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016.\"\nAt first glance it might seem as if Parnas and Fruman were just doing Giuliani's bidding when, in 2019, they started pushing the same disinformation. But Giuliani wasn't paying them \u2014 they were paying Giuliani. Parnas, in turn, was being paid by Firtash, who is, according to the Justice Department, an \"upper echelon\" associate of Russian organized crime. Firtash is also close to the Kremlin; a Ukrainian official once described him as \"representing Russia's interests in Ukraine.\"\nFirtash, who made his fortune as a middleman in Ukraine's natural gas industry, is stuck in Vienna, fighting extradition to the United States for trial on bribery and racketeering charges. Last month, when Parnas and Fruman were arrested while attempting to leave the United States on one-way tickets, Vienna was their destination.\nOn Friday, CNN reported that Parnas boasted of the \"luxurious lifestyle\" Firtash bankrolled. \"Beginning in mid-August, this included around-the-clock bodyguards, two luxury S.U.V.s for his entourage, and at least six private charter flights in the past several months,\" CNN said. It's hard to imagine what Firtash would have been paying for besides access to Trump.\nIt was reportedly Firtash's lawyers who first obtained an affidavit from the fired Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin claiming, falsely, that Joe Biden had targeted Shokin for investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company that had Hunter Biden on its board. Giuliani would later wave this affidavit around on cable television as proof of his claims against Joe Biden.\nFirtash's motives aren't hard to grasp. As he fights extradition, he has obvious reasons to want to ingratiate himself with Trump. It was in his interest to see the former ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, fired, because her work against corruption \u2014 particularly her support for the reform-minded chief executive of Naftogaz, Ukraine's national gas company \u2014 threatened his business interests. And by helping to spread damaging conspiracy theories about Ukraine, he aided his allies in the Kremlin. \"It serves the interest of Russian intelligence to cause further consternation and confusion by pointing the finger at Ukraine rather than Russia for the 2016 successful disinformation campaign,\" said McCallion.\nIn court last month, a lawyer for Parnas said that some evidence against him could be subject to executive privilege, apparently because his work with Giuliani overlapped with Giuliani's work for Trump. If that's true, then Firtash is directly linked to America's president. The two men may have used each other, but there's no reason to believe that Trump was the one in control. There was a time when Republicans would be mortified by an American president being manipulated by a figure like Firtash. Lucky for them, they've lost the ability to feel shame."}], "Kara Swisher": [{"idx": 61, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/13/opinion/uber-silicon-valley.html", "text": "Finally, I figured it out: It's a feature, not a bug.\nThat old Silicon Valley bromide was at the center of the finale this week of HBO's satire \"Silicon Valley,\" the show that has perfectly and hysterically skewered tech and all its weirdness for six seasons.\n\"Silicon Valley\" \u2014 from executive producers Mike Judge and Alec Berg \u2014 was always prescient and topical, but the last episode, \"Exit Event,\" nailed the most important point that the series and its motley crew of geeks has made throughout its run. It's a point that explains a lot about where we are today with tech: You can't build a safe internet, even when you try your hardest.\nThe punch line of the series was the perfect metaphor for today's real-life digital landscape: A groundbreaking artificial-intelligence platform called Pied Piper (the actual product is called PiperNet) had become potentially dangerous and rats got activated to destroy the creation. (I should mention that I've made guest appearances on the show, playing myself.)\nSo if you want to know why so much of tech has seemed to become ever scarier \u2014 whether you read the report out last week from Uber about sexual assaults taking place across its car-hailing business, or the multipart series in The New York Times on how services like gaming or video platforms have become hunting grounds for pedophiles, or listened to numerous Republican politicians spew propaganda online about Ukraine meddling in American elections \u2014 let me break it down for you.\nSimply put, far too many of the people who have designed the wondrous parts of the internet \u2014 thinking up cool new products to make our lives easier, distributing them across the globe and making fortunes doing so \u2014 have never felt unsafe a day in their lives.\nThey've never felt a twinge of fear getting into a stranger's car. They've never imagined the pain of privacy violations, because rarely have they been hacked or swatted or doxed. They've not been stalked or attacked or zeroed out because of their gender, race or sexual orientation. They've never had to think about the consequences of bad choices, because there have been almost no consequences of failure. They have never worried about losing their high-level status, living lives defined by the line on their company growth charts: \"up and to the right.\"\nLiterally, up and to the right. Despite all the mishegas over everything from election interference to hate speech to disinformation to screen addiction to President Trump's toxic tweets, after a tough 2018, tech shares in the S&P 500 are up more than 40 percent as 2019 comes to a close, way above the overall index.\nAmazon is up 16 percent. Alphabet has soared close to 29 percent. Microsoft is zeroing in on a 50 percent gain, while Apple is killing it at 70 percent. And Facebook, the social networking giant that has attracted the ire of so many for so much? Up 53 percent.\nBig tech includes the most valuable companies on the planet, with two in the trillion-dollar valuation club (Apple and Microsoft), one coming close (Amazon) and another closer (Alphabet).\nWhich is why I found it striking and laudable that it was Uber \u2014 whose shares have plummeted since its I.P.O. in May \u2014 that was out front as the year ends by delivering on its promise to publicly reveal all of the unsafe incidents on its platform.\nThe report the company delivered last week noted that it had more than 3,000 incidents of sexual assault of varying degrees in 2018, a small number compared to the overall ride volume, even though that's a higher number than reported on other transportation systems.\nAmong the problems were shoddy background checks. How well \u2014 or not \u2014 the company vetted its drivers has been a long-running problem that its more recently appointed managers have been trying to fix.\n\"The numbers are jarring and hard to digest,\" said Uber's chief legal officer, Tony West, in an interview last week in The New York Times. \"What it says is that Uber is a reflection of the society it serves.\"\nWhile Mr. West has a point \u2014 humans often do act like beasts \u2014 it's one that tech companies often rely on as a go-to explanation for misdeeds. When things go wrong, executives often point to the cruel world and say that they cannot control how their inventions are used by the teeming masses and the inevitable malevolents. Also often pointed out: The bad acting is just a tiny sliver of the massive use of their products.\nAll true, but that's actually the bug, not the feature. The real problem, which was perfectly depicted on \"Silicon Valley,\" is that thoughtlessness is a feature, lack of reflection is a feature, a drive to grow at all costs is a feature and, most of all, the sloppy and lazy ways in which tech too often designs and deploys its inventions are the ultimate features.\nUber had been the poster child for this, of course, with its go-go-damn-the-torpedoes ethos under the co-founder and former chief executive Travis Kalanick. While creating a product that hit the bull's-eye of a market need, it did so by flouting regulations meant to protect customers, like doing those pesky background checks and crowing about how you had to drive fast to win big.\nEven now, Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi \u2014 who replaced Mr. Kalanick after he was ousted for hit-and-running over a lot of stuff \u2014 is still cleaning up the mess and trying to put in place safety features that should have been there in the first place. He's had to awkwardly bolt them on, of course, because the idea of thinking of safety first has never been at the heart of anything Uber or most of Silicon Valley does.\nSo, kudos to Uber for at least putting a mirror to the ugly parts of its face and not looking away. Like all of tech \u2014 whether it is around issues of privacy, disinformation, hate speech, screen addiction or the abuse of children online \u2014 the company probably should have thought of it at the beginning, rather than after damage was done.\n\"There is no law, regulation or lawsuit that is forcing Uber to make this data available,\" Mr. West said to The Times. \"We are doing this, frankly, because the public has a right to know.\"\nThe truth is, we always did."}, {"idx": 62, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/opinion/google-larry-page-sergey-brin.html", "text": "There were louder executives at Google. There were brainier ones. There were more aggressive ones and those who were doubtlessly better at throwing a sharp elbow, too. And many more political ones \u2014 even if those who have been running one of the world's most powerful companies continued to think of themselves as benign, long after it was clear to everyone else that they were many things but that.\nMost of them are gone. Most are as rich as Croesus. But they're not at the pinnacle of one of the mightiest companies on the planet.\nBecause in the end, the nice guy \u2014 Sundar Pichai \u2014 finished first. Mr. Pichai on Tuesday was named chief executive of Alphabet, the company chassis under which the unbeatable and wildly profitable search engine lives, along with a number of other less impressive initiatives. The soft-spoken executive, who was born in India, had worked his way up a long ladder from product manager to vice president to chief executive of Google. Now this big announcement.\nBecause the myth of the founder is so strong in Silicon Valley, the end of the era of the two quirky founders \u2014 Larry Page, who was chief executive, and Sergey Brin, who was president \u2014 seems like a big deal.\nIn reality, the pair have been managing very little of the real business, having checked out a long time ago. Their myriad interests have diverged from running the business that allowed them to have myriad interests. (Google's first \"adult\" supervision \u2014 the former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt \u2014 has also moved on.)\nBut in giving up their executive titles, Mr. Brin and Mr. Page will give up none of their power. The pair \u2014 who at times are still called \"the boys\" internally, even though they are both 46 \u2014 will remain on the board and will also continue to hold most of the company's voting shares, giving them de facto control.\nIn their letter bidding this faux adieu, they played the role of two super-hip dads who were ready to say goodbye to the 21-year-old company they started in a garage (yes, as clich\u00e9d as it sounds, it was just that) to the hilt:\n\"While it has been a tremendous privilege to be deeply involved in the day-to-day management of the company for so long, we believe it's time to assume the role of proud parents \u2014 offering advice and love, but not daily nagging!\"\nWhat an adorkable metaphor \u2014 even though they'll keep nagging.\nStill, the patient Mr. Pichai will finally be the face of the company, and in that he is like Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Tim Cook of Apple, both of whom were loyal lieutenants given the reins by charismatic leaders.\nAnd that is what is most important, since the company Mr. Pichai now leads faces its most vexing challenges ever. They include struggling with the ever-louder voices of employees \u2014 whom Mr. Brin and Mr. Page reared to be very noisy \u2014 as they speak out about whom the company should do business with and how best to deal with sexual harassment, lack of diversity, hate speech and the manipulation of its platforms like YouTube.\nAnd there's the external pressure from regulators worldwide who wonder how big is too big and a media that no longer thinks tech hung the moon.\nAnd even though these messes were all the inevitable result of how Mr. Page and Mr. Brin built it all in the first place, there was a feeling that if only they re-engaged, it would all go back to a time when life was more \"Googley.\" That is the term the company used a lot when it was young, and while it's certainly charming, it represents high-minded ideals that have been a burden to live up to.\nNow it's clear that the buck will stop with Mr. Pichai, ending confusion both inside and outside about who was in charge. His purview is large, including search, advertising, mapping, smartphones, video, drones, artificial intelligence and, as recently announced, new breakthroughs in quantum computing, the next great arena in tech.\nIt was only a month ago that Google said it had achieved \"quantum supremacy.\" As The New York Times noted:\nWe'll see. And we'll be watching as Mr. Pichai pilots Alphabet and Google to their next destination.

He's gotten awfully good at it \u2014 he posts and retweets frequently and expertly, attracting a lot of fans, including me.\nWhat he's doing on Twitter, many suggest, may be one big honking subtweet aimed at Ms. Conway \u2014 a senior adviser to Mr. Trump who is also his wife. Or, others insist, his very public attacks on his wife's boss could be a long-planned con by the two of them to parlay their relationship into a modern and meaner version of the Mary Matalin-James Carville performance from the Bill Clinton years. \nBut Mr. Conway has never aimed his sharp-edged Twitter wit directly at Ms. Conway, who has been one of Mr. Trump's most fervent and shameless defenders.\nUntil Monday, that is, when Mr. Conway let loose a response to a particularly vile tweet from Ms. Conway, whose noisome online style is as subtle as a giant mallet to the head and a stark contrast to his surgical eviscerations.\nMs. Conway started by commenting on a goofy video of Joe Biden talking about hair on his legs (for reasons I still do not understand): \"Watch: Sleepy Joe is Creepy Joe. We need Ukraine's help to defeat this guy?\"\nAnd Mr. Conway responded, this time talking directly to her (even though it was really a retweet with a comment): \"Your boss apparently thought so.\"\nBoom! went the internet. \nApparently this was considered a crossing of the fourth wall. No one expected it. \"Quid pro whoa!\" replied one person perfectly, as others weighed in with comments pro (Go, George!) and con (Don't dunk on your wife, George!). Some delighted (popcorn time!) and some were horrified (Make it stop!) and so many \"OMG\" GIFs that the meme bank is overdrawn for the week.\nAnd while it is easy to dwell on the Conways' marriage here \u2014 even though they are the only ones who have any idea what the state of their relationship is \u2014 the point to be made is much larger.\nA friend of mine who knows a lot about the swamp that is Washington summed it up best in an exasperated text: \"If Trump is the excuse for everyone to behave badly, then we are never going to get back to a semblance of normal.\"\nNo, we are not. The Conway show has much less to do with the two stars than where we have let ourselves go. In the words of Pogo, we have met the enemy and he is us.\nMany people object to the idea that every one of us is to blame for the sorry state of civility, which has brought to new lows of awful by tech tools all invented right here in the U.S. of A. \nI have spent a lot of time writing and talking about those whom I think carry a lot of the culpability \u2014 the tech companies and their leaders who reap all of the money and pay for almost none of the negative impact of the inventions they sowed; regulators who have turned a blind eye to doing anything about it; and, of course, Mr. Trump, whose digital persona (and his analog one, too) delights in cruelty, bathes in conspiracy, traffics in propaganda and lives in a narcissistic fun house that is decidedly unfun for far too many.\nAnd let's not leave out Russian bots and government agents who seek to create discord. Or the racist and misogynist hate-speechers who want to set back all of the painful progress we have made toward a more just world. Or the vicious autocrats who manipulate to keep their nasty grips on power.\nIt remains true that a great deal of the liability lies with them.\nBut. But. But. What about us? \nI know that I now get more pleasure than I should at poking those online with whom I disagree. I know that the decision to tweet something canny but perhaps not so nice has become easier over time. I know I drink up the direct hits people make \u2014 often on those who deserve them \u2014 with gusto.\nIs this a good thing? Is this a bad thing? What I do know is that it is something we all need to think about much more carefully if we are to recover some degree of comity in our society. \n\"Folks want to live in the Trump gutter because they think there is no other way,\" wrote my frustrated friend to me.\nSo I ask: Did Ms. Conway deserve the retweet from Mr. Conway or should he have let her have her ugly words and leave it at that?\nI have no clear answer, except to say in this very noisy digital landscape we need to find a better way to not get along. "}, {"idx": 64, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/27/opinion/tech-dual-class-stock.html", "text": "\"Presidents are not kings,\" wrote Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia this week, in a 120-page decision in the ongoing fight between President Trump and the House Democrats over whether current and former senior White House officials must comply with congressional subpoenas in the impeachment inquiry.\n \"They do not have subjects, bound by loyalty or blood, whose destiny they are entitled to control,\" Ms. Jackson wrote.\nFor that kind of power, Mr. Trump would have to turn the United States government into a major tech company. He'd love that, since it would be just like the Trump Organization, except actually profitable. \nIn tech today, chief executive-founders are often emperors of everything, with complete dominion over shareholders, employees, boards and their users across the planet.\nAnd, unlike golf-course kingdoms with questionable profitability, tech companies have all the real power these days: as data monarchs, nabobs of news, sovereigns of communications and lords of information. \nNo substantive laws govern tech. Most important, many leaders of these powerhouse companies are in effect unfireable: in order to get the boot, they essentially have to fire themselves. And guess how often that happens? \nWelcome to the world of perpetual dual-class stock, an old finance trick that has been used \u2014 and now abused \u2014 with great enthusiasm by the tech giants. \nThe car-sharing firm Lyft has it. Dropbox has it. Snap has it. Google's parent company Alphabet has it. WeWork's co-founder and chief executive had so much control of the company that investors were forced to pay him a king's ransom to go away in preparation of an I.P.O. (which was later abandoned). And, perhaps most important of all, Facebook has it.\nIn a dual-class stock structure, a company issues shares to some shareholders that give them more voting rights, and sometimes other powers. Most simply, the general public gets shares with less voting power, and sometimes with none at all (Snap made this famous). With perpetual dual-class stock, founders and their families, and perhaps other key executives, get shares with voting power that gives them control over a company forever.\nVarious versions of dual-class stocks have been around for a long time. The founders of the Ford Motor Company used them to protect their long-term vision against investor short-termism. It's also been employed by family-owned media giants, like The New York Times Company, Viacom and News Corp, which arguably have mission-driven businesses.\nBut tech has taken the use of the dual-class stock organization to new heights. More than 50 percent of tech companies use it, and often from their very beginning as start-ups. \nFounders have always been the golden children of Silicon Valley, despite their occasional tantrums. Protecting them has been a paramount concern, even if most venture capitalists say off the record that they hate giving total control over to them. But accepting dual-class structure is often the price of getting in on the next big thing. \nIt's easy to see the wisdom in this arrangement. Ideas need time to germinate and grow at the start of an innovative enterprise. And unpopular decisions by chief executives, made with the long term in mind, may need to be protected from interference from activist shareholders, who may be too focused on short-term performance.\nSome academic research touts the benefits of dual-class stocks \u2014 although just as many studies show the drawbacks over time. Those include lower stock returns, higher executive compensation, more kooky acquisitions and, of course, management that never pays the price for bad calls or behavior.\nHere's the problem with tech companies using dual-class stock schemes: They can work well until they do not. \nI'm not alone. Some experts have been calling for imposing new legislation to improve the system. One way to do that is mandatory sunsetting of dual-class stocks (which some companies do voluntarily): After a period of time, the shares automatically convert to single class. \nBut how to be flexible about the time period \u2014 since some companies mature more quickly than others? \n\"The question is how long should it be before the C.E.O. is held accountable?\" said Robert Jackson, a Securities and Exchange commissioner, in a recent interview. Mr. Jackson thinks we should start by saying \"not forever.\"\n\"We're creating a class of royalty that controls our national dialogue,\" he said. \"Not only can you not fire Mark Zuckerberg, you can't fire his kids or his kid's kids.\"\nMark Zuckerberg's kid's kids? While that scenario seems unlikely, it is why dual-class stock that never ends has been increasingly under attack \u2014 and sometimes from powerful investor groups.\nThe Investor Stewardship Group and The Council of Institutional Investors, with billions in assets, have been calling for the limiting of dual-class stock after seven years. C.I.I. and other big investors filed a petition to do just that a year ago to the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.\n\"The petition's over a year old. What do you think's happened so far?,\" said Mr. Jackson. \"Nothing.\"\nIn other words, long live the kings."}, {"idx": 65, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/opinion/google-political-ads.html", "text": "This was a bad week for the head of the Trump campaign, Brad Parscale, but not because of the blockbuster testimony of America's ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, in the impeachment hearings linking his boss to the pay-for-play scheme in Ukraine.\nGoogle announced on Wednesday that it would start to rein in its political advertising business. Mr. Parscale \u2014 an Olympic manipulator of digital information who specializes in creating disingenuous political ads filled with conspiracy theories \u2014 will now have one less weapon in his digital arsenal to wage his scorched-earth re-election campaign.\nHe responded to the news with typical pique, tweeting at Google: \"Political elites & Big Tech want to rig elections \u2014 Dem primary & 2020 included. They're targeting Trump because he's the big dog, but they're after Dems like Sanders & Warren. Won't stop until they control all digital political speech.\"\nGoogle does not plan to completely ban political advertising. But the new policy will hinder many political campaign operatives \u2014 and Mr. Parscale most of all since he is the most deft user of tech tools in politics. The Trump campaign continues to outspend and outperform all the Democratic wannabes on digital combined. \nCampaigns will still be able to target ads on Google based on users' age, gender, location and the content of websites users have visited. But now they cannot direct their ads using several specific audience attributes, like political affiliation or public voting records. Campaigns will no longer be able to microtarget \u2014 tailoring ads to people's specific data and behavior \u2014 which is the online equivalent of whispering millions of different messages into zillions of different ears for maximum effect and with minimum scrutiny.\nAnd political organizations will no longer be able to reach \"affinity audiences,\" groups of users who are bundled according to similar habits. Google also clarified its rules around lack of truth advertising, banning ads with \"demonstrably false claims that could significantly undermine participation or trust\" in elections. And more: Campaigns cannot use specific names they have collected to target ads, and Google also disallowed \"remarketing\" to those who visit campaign web sites. \nTwitter's recent decision to get out of the political ad business altogether set this in motion. But Twitter's move was mostly symbolic: Its political advertising business is small and not particularly critical for candidates, since they can continue to tweet to their heart's delight.\nGoogle \u2014 the search giant that also owns YouTube \u2014 is another story. Google and Facebook are the only two Big Tech players that matter in digital advertising, given the vast amounts of data they have sucked up on every aspect of the digital lives of billions of users.\nIn its public statements, Google sought to tie itself closely to old media, which has a lot of experience with political advertising. \"This will align our approach to election ads with long-established practices in media such as TV, radio and print, and result in election ads being more widely seen and available for public discussion,\" wrote a vice president for Google's ads, Scott Spencer, sounding as if he were older and wiser than tech has been.\nAll eyes are now on Facebook. Google has largely skated clear of the mess around false political ads and disinformation, at least compared with Facebook, which has gotten the lion's share of the complaints. \n\"Twitter fired the starting gun, and Google just cranked it up to 11,\" said Eric Wilson, a Republican digital advertising strategist, in an interview with The New York Times. \"Now the pressure is on Facebook \u2014 they're going to have to act.\" \nWill Facebook finally get serious about the problems resulting from political advertising on its platform?\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, hasn't yet budged on this: He recently said that the company would continue to allow politicians to lie in ads. And Facebook has decided not remove some of the more egregious examples of disinformation. \"Drunk Nancy Pelosi\" is one such case \u2014 and they keep coming. \nStill, despite Mr. Zuckerberg's recent pronouncements, there have been murmurs leaking out of Facebook about political ad changes of its own. Of course, any change of policy at Facebook lies with Mr. Zuckerberg, who has total control of the company and is often pushed to make policy shifts only after disasters stack up. \nSo Mr. Parscale tweeted this week to an audience of one, Mr. Zuckerberg, reacting to these numerous reports that Facebook is contemplating making its own changes: \"@facebook wants to take important tools away from us for 2020. Tools that help reach more great Americans & lift voices the media & big tech choose to ignore!\"\nTranslation: If Facebook imposes some reasonable new rules and restrictions on political advertising to make it more transparent and less easy to manipulate, however can we gin up the next Pizzagate?\nMany campaigns are also worried about the Google restrictions \u2014 several Democrats and grass-roots organizations have noted they might hurt smaller organizations and their ability to find voters. But a Facebook limit on paid political ads would have much more impact on the whole presidential race. \nSo whether Google finally gives Facebook the courage \u2014 and cover \u2014 to make its own changes in its fruitful relationship with Mr. Trump, or stand pat, has all of Washington agog. \nMr. Sondland might be where the political drama was taking place, but make no mistake: The real show is here with Big Tech."}, {"idx": 66, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/opinion/disney-plus-streaming-netflix.html", "text": "Have you heard of \"The Mandalorian\"?\nIf not, you most certainly will, given that the Walt Disney Company signed up an impressive 10 million subscribers for the streaming video service it rolled out this week. \n\"The Mandalorian\" \u2014 a bounty-hunting, cape-heavy spinoff of the \"Star Wars\" franchise \u2014 is the flagship of the many original series that the company has stuffed into the new Disney Plus, its attempt to break into the crowded streaming space that for years has been dominated by Netflix.\n\"Now is the winter of our Disney content,\" someone tweeted perfectly.\nWall Street is going crazy over the achievement and is lauding the company for what seems to many like an overnight digital success. \nBut, while the praise is deserved, the story of Disney and the internet is more like \"The Empire Finally Strikes Back\": The company has been trying for 25 years to tame the online medium, and most of its efforts have fallen flat.\nThat's why this triumph is certainly a credit to the Disney chief executive, Bob Iger, who told me of his commitment to getting digital right back in a 2006 interview, just after he got the top job. \"If someone's going to eat our digital lunch, it might as well be us,\" he said.\nAt that point, he must have been starving, since the company had already been through a decade of huge and ill-conceived tech missteps under his predecessor, Michael Eisner. \nMr. Iger would continue struggling for years to cook up the right meal, but his efforts will become a case study in dogged tenacity and a willingness to keep on going despite myriad setbacks.\nForget the dashing Mandalorian. Do you remember Starwave? Infoseek? Go? Daily Blast? Spoonful.com? Club Penguin? Tapulous? Maker Studios?\nI'd like to say I don't either, but I know them very well. They were among the many failed efforts by Disney that I have covered as a reporter since the mid-1990s, when it became clear to Disney that this internet thing just might be a big deal.\nUnfortunately for Disney executives, the surging successes of many digital companies had not been shared by them, as they spent huge amounts of time, effort and, of course, money with little result while new companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon became multibillion-dollar behemoths.\nThey weren't alone. It was a path shared by many legacy-media giants. For example, News Corporation's internet graveyard includes MySpace, The Daily, Delphi Internet Service and Iguide, all of which resulted in not much.\nBut Disney continued plugging along \u2014 over all the others. This digital transformation has been a Disney dream from the moment it formed the Disney Online unit in the summer of 1995 under the guidance of another executive, Jake Winebaum.\nMr. Winebaum was certainly a tech enthusiastic, rolling out DisneyStore.com and also Family.com, which was soon merged with the Seattle-based Starwave's Family Planet and then was morphed into Dailyblast.com, a family-focused content subscription site. In 1998, there came a directory called Dig.com (short for Disney Internet Guide), and then the company acquired a search engine called InfoSeek, an also-ran to Yahoo that became Go.\nOn and on and on it went with acquisitions and more: Kaboose.com, Babble.com, AmazingMoms.com and even one called Kerpoof.com. That maker of cartoon avatars and Kerpoof Koins went, as did most of these efforts, kerpoof. \nAnd more: There were toys and games, and toys-to-games, and so many names and name changes of its digital units: Disney Online, Disney Interactive, Buena Vista Internet Group, Disney Interactive Studios, Disney Interactive Media Group \u2026\nAlong the way, there were layoffs, lots of them, even as the company kept at it, spending enough money to make Scrooge McDuck scream, as well as placing lots of investment bets. They included $400 million in Vice Media, which Disney wrote down this year to nothing, and a 2014 purchase of YouTube-focused Maker Studios for $675 million.\nBut Mr. Iger persisted. I've always admired his attitude compared to the other legacy-media moguls who were openly disdainful of the internet for far too long.\n\"I have tried to keep two obvious philosophies,\" he said to me in 2010. \"First, that our current business not get in the way of adopting new technologies, and, second, that our business belongs on these new platforms.\" And a year later in another interview, he noted: \"I'm not in the camp that believes that Netflix is going to take over the world. Technology makes it impossible to have a monopoly.\"\nAnd now that same belief is what remains, and it's the driver of Disney Plus, at about $7 a month a streaming service intended to undercut Netflix with its $13 price tag. It includes originals from Marvel, Pixar, Lucasfilm (a.k.a. Star Wars), National Geographic and all of the shows it acquired in buying Fox Studios (\"The Simpsons,\" of course), as well as the trove of Disney classics. It is also including its more adult-themed Hulu and sports ESPN Plus streaming services in a $12 bundle. There are discounts and partnership deals to try to muscle Disney into a market that also includes Apple, Amazon and soon a larger AT&T WarnerMedia effort (there is already HBO Go).\nIt's all pretty fantastic, which is why this is finally perhaps the moment that Disney gets to gorge, as it concentrates on exploiting its content and stops chasing other tech dreams it could never be good at.\nBut make no mistake, it's turned out to be a pricey lunch, as it will continue to be. The budget for \"The Mandalorian\" is reportedly $15 million an episode, for example.\nThat said, that single first show saw two million streams on its first day. Kerpoof? Hardly.

This is the man who very likely ordered the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year; a man I call the thug's thug.\nThe first bit of news further burnished Prince Mohammed's awful reputation: Federal prosecutors accused two former Twitter employees, with a skein of ties to the prince, of using their roles at the tech platform to spy on dissidents for the Saudi government.\n\"The criminal complaint unsealed today alleges that Saudi agents mined Twitter's internal systems for personal information about known Saudi critics and thousands of other Twitter users,\" David Anderson, the United States attorney for the Northern District of California, told The Washington Post about the spying that took place several years ago. \"We will not allow U.S. companies or U.S. technology to become tools of foreign repression in violation of U.S. law.\"\nExcept that is exactly what appears to have happened \u2014 and it feels dire. The complaint sounds like a geeky version of a spy movie, but it boils down to an all-too-familiar scheme when it comes to tech these days: A foreign government exploiting our digital tools for its gain \u2014 in this case by suppressing legitimate voices of dissent \u2014 while also damaging our safety and any remaining trust we may have in Big Tech.\nMore to the point, the Twitter spy story puts into sharp relief just how difficult it is to manage these sprawling platforms at all, both internally and externally, as they are continually pummeled with all sorts of vexing challenges.\nThe Twitter chief executive and co-founder Jack Dorsey admitted as much last week when he announced that the platform would end the sale of political ads on the service. While he did not rule out reversing the ban in the future, he noted, \"It's worth stepping back in order to address\" the weaknesses in our systems.\nBut in this case of the Saudi spies within Twitter it's hard to step back, because the company, like all the other tech behemoths, relies on a robust and growing tech force. And ensuring that these techies are not up to no good is never going to be easy or perfectly handled.\nIn fact, it might be impossible, given all the incentives that all kinds of bad actors \u2014 foreign governments and many others \u2014 have to infiltrate these gigantic repositories of information on all of humanity.\nLet me underscore that: all of humanity. Everything we do and everywhere we go. An old clich\u00e9 goes that you rob banks because that's where the money is, so it stands to reason that you find every which way you can to plunder Google and Facebook and Twitter and Amazon because that's where the golden veins of data are.\nIncreased vetting of tech workers by the companies is likely. And there will be increased scrutiny by federal investigators of not only what is being done with our data but also who is monitoring it. I have gotten many tips over the years of potential spies inside the major tech companies, and I cannot imagine how hard it is to ferret them out internally.\nThat's why the developing case at Twitter will be important to watch. One of the accused former employees, Ahmad Abouammo, is a United States citizen and worked as a media partnerships manager, according to the complaint filed by prosecutors. The complaint accuses him of spying on three accounts for the Saudis. He also allegedly made up fake invoices for work and was paid for all the skulduggery with cash and a pricey watch. He has been arrested.\nThe other alleged principal perpetrator, Ali Alzabarah, a Saudi citizen who worked at Twitter as a site reliability manager, seems to have been more industrious in his spying. He is apparently in Saudi Arabia now and is accused of sneaking around more than 6,000 accounts on behalf of higher-ups in Saudi Arabia who appear connected to Prince Mohammed.\nWhile Twitter noted this week that it restricted access to sensitive information to a \"limited group of trained and vetted employees\" and that more generally, as a platform, it remains committed to those who take great risks to hold power accountable, the vulnerable points for entering these platforms are too irresistible and too numerous.\nThen again, you can also just walk in the front door, as Saudi Arabia did at Twitter. \nIn 2015, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz Alsaud, who had already invested $300 million in Twitter through the Kingdom Holding Company in 2011, upped his investment and became the second-largest shareholder, a stake bigger than Mr. Dorsey's. He was briefly jailed by Prince Mohammed in 2017, was freed in 2018 and has since been making more tech investments.\nAnd Twitter has not been the only tech giant fueled by Saudi money. Saudi Arabia's sovereign Public Investment Fund put up nearly half of the money for SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund in 2016. Even though that investment has been a wash, a result most spectacularly of floundering investments in WeWork (see the slide deck that SoftBank put out this week if you want an entertaining magic trick to watch money disappear), the Public Investment Fund is reportedly considering contributing to a second Vision Fund.\nMeanwhile, Saudi money continues to wash throughout tech start-ups in Silicon Valley, even though quite a bit of it is deep under water, including at the car-hailing company Uber. \nTravis Kalanick, the ousted chief executive and current board member of Uber, engineered Saudi investments in the company. While Uber insiders tell me there is an internal debate about the company's continued association with Saudi Arabia, the Public Investment Fund's managing director, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, remains on the Uber board. I am under no illusions that Silicon Valley will stop taking ever-dirtier Saudi money. But tossing Mr. al-Rumayyan off the board would go a long way in acknowledging the problem.\nWhich brings us to another investment we learned about this week \u2014 and the timing was just about perfect. (And by perfect, I mean it's spectacularly awful and awkward.)\nIn what appears to be the first known direct funding of an American start-up since the Khashoggi murder, Mr. Kalanick has received some $400 million from the Public Investment Fund for a \"ghost kitchen\" delivery start-up called CloudKitchens. That service \u2014 which, as much as I disdain Mr. Kalanick's behavior as Uber's leader, I must admit, is a fascinating idea \u2014 is now valued at $5 billion. It has its own food delivery services with names like Excuse My French Toast and B*tch Don't Grill My Cheese.\n\"Does ANYTHING sound LESS appetizing than a stew made from Saudi Arabia and Travis Kalanick,\" wrote one person on Twitter.\nOy. As I said, all they have is money."}, {"idx": 68, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/opinion/political-advertising-facebook-twitter.html", "text": "That's one small step by @jack, one giant leap for tweetkind.\nIt's not as significant as man conquering space, but Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, moonwalked into the digital future on Wednesday with a move that was both unexpected and inevitable. In a Twitter thread (of course), he declared that the company would no longer allow \"political advertising on Twitter globally.\"\nTo those hoping that Mr. Dorsey would also take action against one of the platform's most famous rules violators, let's make one thing clear: @realdonaldtrump can still huff and puff away on his disingenuous digital sousaphone, but his campaign cannot pay to do so.\nStill, it was a bold and epic poke that seemed aimed directly at Mark Zuckerberg, since Twitter's announcement came just as Facebook was dropping its current earnings report. While Facebook's earnings were spectacular \u2014 especially in comparison to Twitter's weaker showing a week ago \u2014 the announcement now places Twitter and Mr. Dorsey in stark contrast to the social networking giant and its co-founder and C.E.O.\nWhy? Well, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a disastrous series of recent appearances in Washington, D.C., that his huge platform would not only keep accepting political ads, but would also allow politicians to lie in them.\nCoincidence? Actually, it feels like the best subtweet ever. It is yet another example \u2014 like last year's widespread deplatforming of the conspiracy troll Alex Jones \u2014 of social media not only starting to clean itself up but also beginning to understand the major responsibility it has to the well-being of society at large, well beyond just making money.\nMr. Dorsey said as much in his tweets: \"This isn't about free expression. This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today's democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It's worth stepping back in order to address.\"\nAnd it is worth stepping back to address this. The social media platforms have become hostage to all forms of abuse and manipulation, not just via political ads, and they've dragged us all with them into the cesspool. The growth-at-all-costs mentality of Silicon Valley, as it turns out, has costs.\nCleaning up political ads is only a start, and it's some of Twitter's low-hanging and less problematic fruit. It also relieves the company of a major headache that was yielding much more pain than benefit and could be a big public relations win. Like Facebook and YouTube, Twitter has been facing a buzz saw of criticism from the news media and regulators worldwide for the way it manages the information posted on the platform.\nSo why not just throw in the towel and admit that controlling this mess was not within its power or purview? Doubtless, big debates about free speech will be raised about the new policy, but no company has to sell ads it doesn't want to sell. And, as much as it feels like it is a public square, Twitter is a private enterprise that can make money any way it likes.\nThat was among the reasons Mr. Dorsey cited in his tweets, saying that the company was much more comfortable letting people earn their reach and that paying to do so compromised that trade \u2014 which, of course, is the point of all advertising. He did note that commercial advertising was different and called political ads more dangerous since they \"can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions.\" Again, that has always been the point.\nStill, he presented as thoughtful an analysis as you can do in 280 characters: \"Internet political ads present entirely new challenges to civic discourse: machine learning-based optimization of messaging and micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information and deep fakes. All at increasing velocity, sophistication, and overwhelming scale.\"\nHe went on to say that regular Twitter communications also had major issues, but said that was a fight for another day. \"Trying to fix both means fixing neither well, and harms our credibility,\" he wrote.\nMr. Dorsey noted that the ban, which will take effect Nov. 22, will also cover issues ads, although Twitter will exempt some topics, like voter registration. And he called for political ad regulation well beyond simply ad transparency.\nIn effect, he made a dare to the whole internet power structure, especially to Facebook, which is the platform that matters most when it comes to politics because of the effectiveness of its ad targeting and its size. \nMr. Zuckerberg wasn't having any of it when he addressed analysts on his earnings call, keeping up the same arguments that I called lightweight and reductive in a recent column.\n\"In a democracy, I don't think it's right for private companies to censor politicians or the news. And although I've considered whether we should not carry these ads in the past, and I'll continue to do so, on balance so far I've thought we should continue,\" he said, expertly but wrongly conflating free speech with paid speech and conveniently leaving out the part about allowing lies. \"Ads can be an important part of voice \u2014 especially for candidates and advocacy groups the media might not otherwise cover so they can get their message into debates.\"\nHis solution, noting he did not want to draw the line: \"Would we really block ads for important political issues like climate change or women's empowerment? Instead, I believe the better approach is to work to increase transparency.\"\nAnd now we have the big question: In this game of internet chicken, will Mr. Zuckerberg eventually flinch, as he did with Mr. Jones, whom he allowed on his platform until he didn't?\nWell, for starters, he might want to think about a less-famous message Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin left behind when they headed back to Earth in July of 1969: \"We came in peace for all mankind.\""}, {"idx": 69, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/opinion/facebook-zuckerberg-free-speech.html", "text": "So, sort of free speech.\nThat was my thought last week as I sat in an auditorium at Georgetown University in Washington listening to the most powerful man in media (and, arguably, in politics) present a word salad of a speech claiming that giving people a voice online is the most important function of the vast social-media ecosystem that he has built.\nSo important, he seemed to be saying, that all of the pain from the hate speech, disinformation and actual violence caused by this \"Mark Zuckerberg Production\" \u2014 what the co-founder and chief executive of Facebook had at the bottom of the site's pages in its early days \u2014 pale in comparison. Serious problems have to be tolerated for now because giving people a voice is paramount.\nIt was ironic that the largely student audience was not permitted to ask questions after Mr. Zuckerberg gave a talk about free speech (he answered questions that had been submitted in advance), but I digress.\n[Kara Swisher answered questions about this column on Twitter.]\nMr. Zuckerberg was back on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to talk about Facebook's digital currency efforts but got a drubbing instead on all kinds of issues. Yet his lightweight speech from last week is still worth our consideration. \nOne of the many valid criticisms of the talk came from Bernice King, a daughter of Martin Luther King Jr. After Mr. Zuckerberg quoted her father in his speech, she tweeted: \"I heard #MarkZuckerberg's 'free expression' speech, in which he referenced my father. I'd like to help Facebook better understand the challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians.\"\nThen she landed a hard truth by posting a famous 1968 photo of the site of Dr. King's murder at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, writing that those \"campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination.\"\nMs. King offered up the sharpest counterpoint to Mr. Zuckerberg's speech: There are consequences to giving people the tools to say anything to a wide audience. \nMr. Zuckerberg presented us with an either-or choice of free speech \u2014 either we have free speech or we're China. \"Whether you like Facebook or not, I think we need to come together and stand for voice and free expression,\" he said with an isn't-this-obvious tone. \nBut, as anyone who has lived in the real world knows, it's much more complex. And that was the main problem with his speech \u2014 and it's also what is at the crux of the myriad concerns we have with tech these days: Big Tech's leaders frame the debate in binary terms. \nMr. Zuckerberg missed an opportunity to recognize that there has been a hidden and high price of all the dazzling tech of the last decade. In offering us a binary view for considering the impact of their inventions, many digital leaders avoid thinking harder about the costs of technological progress.\nConsider the messages tech leaders have been sending us.\nThey tout the convenience of instant delivery and the satisfaction of our needs through retail services like Amazon Prime, and they avoid the complex, negative impact of such services on traditional retailing and the many environmental considerations.\nThey assure us that the effortless ability to learn about anything in a jiffy from a Google search is a dream, and they avoid discussing the potential dangers of our reliance on a centralized information source that also has a major impact on the survival of all kinds of other media.\nThey speak to us of the miracles of keeping us all connected in a global skein of communications and information and commerce with a single hand-held device instead of facing up to the fact that humanity is being sucked into the matrix by addictive technologies that appear to separate us more than bring us together.\nAnd they take a bow for providing us with the ability to say and publish whatever we want instead of adding up the real-world damage those words might cause, especially when spouted by those wishing to sow discord.\nRather than say \"thank you\" to Mr. Zuckerberg for his speech without asking any questions, I would like to discuss how giving marginalized people a voice is different from giving malevolent users the tools to manipulate sloppy digital platforms. I would like to discuss how free speech can be valued and protected, while also putting up guardrails against abuses. I would mostly like not to be lectured to about free speech in the most simplistic of terms by people who avoid hard questions about that freedom.\nJust this week, we faced a typical social-media challenge: Are we any better off because President Trump gets to abuse social media by tweeting out that he was being subjected to a \"lynching\"? Or are we made worse, more exhausted and less united because Mr. Trump is allowed to say whatever he wants online without repercussions?\nSimple questions but no easy answers.\n\"I don't think it's right\" that tech platforms make decisions on free speech, Mr. Zuckerberg said in his speech. Indeed not, but since they control a major means of communication, he and the other leaders of tech companies need to become better thinkers about the problems they have created.\nMr. Zuckerberg \u2014 and all of us \u2014 should consider some other wise words from Dr. King.\n\"An individual has not started living until he can rise above the narrow confines of his individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity,\" he said. \"Rarely do we find men who willingly engage in hard, solid thinking. There is an almost universal quest for easy answers and half-baked solutions. Nothing pains some people more than having to think.\"\nThat's free speech at its finest."}, {"idx": 70, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/opinion/facebook-oversight-board.html", "text": "I would like to formally apply to be judge and jury over Mark Zuckerberg.\nAnd it's not just my dream job if Facebook's newest idea to police itself better goes as planned.\nThe company calls its latest effort to manage the controversial information on its giant social-media service the Oversight Board. The lofty idea is to create a global group \u2014 what some are calling a Supreme Court \u2014 by year's end and make it fully operational by next November. The independent board will judge appeals from users on material that has been taken down from the platform by the company, and it will review policy decisions that the company has submitted to the board.\nIt's much needed. It's hard to miss the rising dissatisfaction and frustration with Facebook. Users, regulators, politicians and the media have had enough with how it has evolved and how the co-creator and chief executive, Mr. Zuckerberg, has been responding to the many problems that seem to pop up daily.\nLast week, we saw yet another controversy over the company's year-old policy to exempt politicians from its third-party fact-checking program, allowing them to lie in paid advertisements. Senator Elizabeth Warren \u2014 the Democratic presidential candidate and Facebook's No. 1 government critic \u2014 gleefully produced a fake ad that appeared on the platform and falsely claimed that Mr. Zuckerberg and his social network support President Trump in the 2020 election.\nThis news came just as Mr. Zuckerberg \u2014 the Ellen DeGeneres of social media \u2014 has been meeting with conservative pundits to soothe their ire over their unproven conspiracy theories about Facebook bias against their right-leaning content.\nMs. Warren's fake ad was clever; it underscored the increasingly dystopian, manipulated, noisy, ugly digital mess that is social media. Sorting out what is permitted on the platform and what is not, what is damaging and what is necessary, has been a gargantuan task for Facebook's leadership. It's a job that many people think the company has failed to figure out, and worse, may be incapable of doing so.\nNow Facebook wants to let you know that it's going to do better, which is the go-to excuse of all tech companies when they screw up, along with the much used: I'm so sorry.\nBut the new idea is different than what came before and also a giant undertaking. The Oversight Board will eventually have 40 part-time members with staggered three-year terms that are renewable for nine years \u2014 and it will be funded through a trust paid for by the company.\nFacebook has presented many ideas over the years to limit the toxicity \u2014 problematic artificial intelligence monitoring or more troubled systems that employ overwhelmed human moderators or even a blog effort in 2017 called \"Hard Questions,\" to name a few.\nBut this latest effort is intriguing \u2014 and even laudable. So, while the possibility of it becoming a giant P.R. Potemkin village to assuage critics is very high, it deserves public support.\nSuccess of the board will depend on whether it has the buy-in of the godlike engineers at the company. In conversations with Facebook executives, I've been assured that the techies indeed support it.\n\"They have been instrumental in thinking through the mechanisms of the board,\" said Heather Moore, who led the effort to write the board's charter, about the tech side of the company. The engineers will have to implement the binding decisions of the board, including sorting through the technical limits of the oversight.\nThat's why, said Brent Harris, the executive in charge of setting up the board, its scope \"will grow over time,\" in order to give its decisions the best possibility for success. That will be true of the appeals that reach the board after they have been exhausted by the Facebook system and also of the company policies that might soon be at odds with the judgments. While deliberations will not be public because of privacy concerns, the decisions will be.\n\"Ultimately, the board will be choosing the significant and most difficult cases,\" added Ms. Moore, \"and cases that Facebook will send for emergency decisions.\"\nPaying for all of the big brains who are needed to pull this off is another challenge. Facebook plans to foot the bill for the judges, but there is no way of getting around the fact that the project has the feeling of a payoff: Can judges who are paid, even indirectly, by Facebook be neutral arbiters of company policy? The leadership hopes that dropping an unspecified amount of dough through an irrevocable grant into a trust that it can never touch will suffice.\nOf course, Facebook should fix its problems itself, not farm out the job. But executives appear to realize this: \"This is in no way a replacement for what we have built,\" Mr. Harris said.\nMs. Moore added that she hoped that the other big platforms might \"have an appetite\" for such a board too, so there is a wider \"standard of consistency\" to deal with what they all have wrought.\nBut will Mr. Zuckerberg give up his unlimited power and submit to the will of others? In his blog post about the board, he insists he's not keen to be Dear Leader anymore: \"The board's decision will be binding, even if I or anyone at Facebook disagrees with it.\"\nOh, really? Then sign me up \u2014 and here comes the judge."}], "David Brooks": [{"idx": 71, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/opinion/UK-election-politics-boris-johnson.html", "text": "There are two power blocs driving politics today. First, there's the proletariat. These are the working-class voters who go to Trump rallies in the U.S. and powered Brexit and Boris Johnson's campaign in the U.K. They see their best world receding and they want a tough guy to bring it back.\nSecond, there is the precariat. These are the young and educated voters caught in the gig economy, who see no career security ahead. They want leaders like Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn who will promise enveloping policies \u2014 free college, free internet, free child care \u2014 to give them some sense of safety.\nThese two groups are different in some ways. When the proletarians attack their enemies, they do so from a position of perceived social inferiority, so their attacks are resentful and brutal. When the precariat attacks, it does so from a position of perceived moral superiority, so its attacks are filled with ridicule, mockery and scorn.\nBut the movements do have parallels. Both are driven by a fear of the future, and of each other. Both have a tendency to embrace catastrophic, apocalyptic visions of the ruin around us. Dystopia has become the opiate of the activist class.\nHaunted by economic insecurity, they will tolerate any sin in their leader \u2014 racism, anti-Semitism, dishonesty \u2014 so long as that person is willing to fight and be on their side. They both support massive, unrealistic policy proposals, because they reject the idea that politics is simply the muddled way we settle differences with people we disagree with.\nThese two power blocs are driving the debate and setting the agenda. But there's another group of people, who have become the most interesting part of the electorate, both here and in Britain. It's the exhausted 75 percent, people who are defined not by any common ideology but by an affective state \u2014 they are simply worn out by the endless war between these two armies. Exhaustion has become an independent force in modern politics. Many people are voting for whatever candidate will exhaust them less.\nThursday's British election was defined by the fact that most voters were simply ground down by Johnson and Corbyn. The Economist called the election \"Britain's nightmare before Christmas.\"\nWriting in The Guardian, Rafael Behr observed, \"We live with the undertow of sadness and dread. We are braced for that feeling, like seeing callous hands rummaging in a private drawer where a delicate, tangled identity is stored and pulling at the threads. It feels like exile.\"\nPeople in the exhausted camp are tired of having politics thrust in their face every hour. As Ryan Streeter of the American Enterprise Institute has found, young people who are \"lonely at least once in a while\" are more than seven times more likely to be active in politics than those who are socially active. Those who are exhausted have other things to do. They want to restore politics to its rightful place, and find meaning, attachment, entertainment and morality in something else besides Twitter wars and election campaigns.\nYears and years of exhaustion have also made these people weary, cynical and disgusted. Exhaustion, as always, induces a sort of pessimism, a feeling that we are living in terrible times, a sort of weariness of the soul. As Peter Stockland of the think tank Cardus put it, \"The combined effect of fear and exhaustion\" is \"producing a cynicism so deep and murky and toxic that it verges on the sin of bearing false witness against reality.\"\nBut the chief feature of the voters in the exhausted group is timidity. They do not get energy from conflict, the way, say, Trump does. Their instinct is to keep their heads down and just get through this craziness.\nOn campuses 10 percent of students are able to intimidate the other 90 percent, who don't want to say the wrong thing and get canceled. In Congress, the Trumpians are able to intimidate the members who realize what a problem he is. The people in the two big power blocs are not good at winning the war against each other, but they are really good at intimidating the moderates on their own side.\nIn this way, those in the exhausted camp perpetuate their own misery. They complain about the terrible choices each election cycle, but never organize enough or become imaginative enough to offer something they themselves might want.\nIn Britain they've mostly taken money out of politics, but they still had an election even worse and more polarized than our own. In the end, if Johnson, as expected, wins easily, it will be in part because exhausted voters will have swung to Trump/Johnson nationalist demagogy since the only alternative is a Corbyn/Sanders class war.\nIn the States, voters still have a chance to turn the emotional page, to elect a person who displays that you can be a progressive or you can be a conservative without turning politics into perpetual war. Pete Buttigieg is rising and Joe Biden's support is resilient precisely because they are not exhausting.\nThe interesting question is whether, in the heat of battle, the exhausted voters can get over their fatigue, cynicism and timidity and take their own side in a fight."}, {"idx": 72, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/opinion/socialism-capitalism.html", "text": "I was a socialist in college. I read magazines like The Nation and old issues of The New Masses. I dreamed of being the next Clifford Odets, a lefty playwright who was always trying to raise proletarian class consciousness. If you go on YouTube and search \"David Brooks Milton Friedman,\" you can see a 22-year-old socialist me debating the great economist. I'm the one with the bushy hair and the giant 1980s glasses that were apparently on loan from the Palomar lunar observatory.\nThe best version of socialism is defined by Michael Walzer's phrase, \"what touches all should be decided by all.\" The great economic enterprises should be owned by all of us in common. Decisions should be based on what benefits all, not the maximization of profit. \nThat's not what \"democratic socialists\" like Bernie Sanders are talking about, but I get why some of their socialist concerns are popular. Why do we have to live with such poverty and inequality? Why can't we put people over profits? What is the best life in the most just society? Socialism is the most compelling secular religion of all time. It gives you an egalitarian ideal to sacrifice and live for.\nMy socialist sympathies didn't survive long once I became a journalist. I quickly noticed that the government officials I was covering were not capable of planning the society they hoped to create. It wasn't because they were bad or stupid. The world is just too complicated.\nI came to realize that capitalism is really good at doing the one thing socialism is really bad at: creating a learning process to help people figure stuff out. If you want to run a rental car company, capitalism has a whole bevy of market and price signals and feedback loops that tell you what kind of cars people want to rent, where to put your locations, how many cars to order. It has a competitive profit-driven process to motivate you to learn and innovate, every single day.\nSocialist planned economies \u2014 the common ownership of the means of production \u2014 interfere with price and other market signals in a million ways. They suppress or eliminate profit motives that drive people to learn and improve.\nIt doesn't matter how big your computers are, the socialist can never gather all relevant data, can never construct the right feedback loops. The state cannot even see the local, irregular, context-driven factors that can have exponential effects. The state cannot predict people's desires, which sometimes change on a whim. Capitalism creates a relentless learning system. Socialism doesn't.\nThe sorts of knowledge that capitalism produces are often not profound, like how to design the best headphone. But that kind of knowledge does produce enormous wealth. Human living standards were pretty much flat for all of human history until capitalism kicked in. Since then, the number of goods and services available to average people has risen by up to 10,000 percent.\nIf you've been around a little while, you've noticed that capitalism has brought about the greatest reduction of poverty in human history. In 1981, 42 percent of the world lived in extreme poverty. Now, it's around 10 percent. More than a billion people have been lifted out of poverty.\nYou've noticed that places that instituted market reforms, like South Korea and Deng Xiaoping's China, tended to get richer and prouder. Places that moved toward socialism \u2014 Britain in the 1970s, Venezuela more recently \u2014 tended to get poorer and more miserable.\nYou've noticed that the environment is much better in capitalist nations than in planned economies. The American G.D.P. has more than doubled since 1970, but energy consumption has risen only modestly. America's per-capita carbon emissions hit a 67-year low in 2017. The greatest environmental degradations are committed by planned systems like the old Soviet Union and communist China.\nThe Fraser Institute is a free-market think tank that ranks nations according to things free-market think tanks like: less regulation, free trade, secure property rights. The freest economies in the world are places like Hong Kong, the U.S., Canada, Ireland, Latvia, Denmark, Mauritius, Malta and Finland. Nations in the top quartile for economic freedom have an average G.D.P. per capita of $36,770. For those in the bottom quartile, it's $6,140. People in the free economies have a life expectancy of 79.4 years. Those in the planned economies have a life expectancy of 65.2 years.\nOver the past century, planned economies have produced an enormous amount of poverty and scarcity. What's worse is what happens when the political elites learn what you can do with that scarcity. They turn scarcity into corruption. When things are scarce, you have to bribe government officials to get them. Soon, everybody is bribing. Citizens soon realize the whole system is a fraud. Socialism produces economic and political inequality as the rulers turn into gangsters. A system that begins in high idealism ends in corruption, dishonesty, oppression and distrust.\nI learned the ills of socialism quickly \u2026 and became a Whig slowly. \nMy first economic hero is Alexander Hamilton. He came to America with almost nothing and found an economy dominated by land-rich oligarchs like Thomas Jefferson. He realized that the solution was to make everyone a capitalist. He created credit markets so that capital would be fluid and more people would have access to investments. \nMy next hero is Abraham Lincoln. He grew up poor and launched his career as a Whig. He gave more speeches on banking and infrastructure projects than on slavery. That's because he wanted to spread capital and grease the wheels of commerce so poor boys and girls like him could rise. He helped create the land-grant colleges so that more people would have the training to compete as capitalists. \nAnother major American figure in the Whig tradition is Theodore Roosevelt. He loved the dynamism that capitalism arouses and knew that sometimes you have to limit giant corporations so millions of less established capitalists can compete. \nAll of these leaders understood that the answer to the problems of capitalism is wider and fairer capitalism.\nToday, parts of our capitalist system in the United States are in good shape. Growth is remarkably steady, inflation is low, employment is high, wages for the poorest Americans are rising twice as fast as for high-wage workers.\nBut capitalism, like all human systems, is always unbalanced one way or another. Over the last generation, capitalism has produced the greatest reduction in global income inequality in history. The downside is that low-skill workers in the U.S. are now competing with workers in Vietnam, India and Malaysia. The reduction of inequality among nations has led to the increase of inequality within rich nations, like the United States.\nAlso, education levels have not kept pace with technology. More people grow up with inadequate schools, disrupted families and fragmented neighborhoods. They find it harder to acquire the skills to become good capitalists. The market is effectively closed off to them.\nThese problems are not signs that capitalism is broken. They are signs that we need more and better capitalism. We need a massive infusion of money and reform into our education systems, from infancy through life. Human capital-building is like nutrition: It's something you have to attend to every day. We need welfare programs that not only subsidize poor people's consumption but also subsidize their capacity to produce.\nWe need worker co-ops, which build skills and represent labor at the negotiating table. We need wage subsidies and mobility subsidies, so people can afford to move to opportunity. We need tax subsidies for health care, to make it easier for people to switch jobs. We need a higher earned-income tax credit, to give the working poor financial security so they don't get swept away amid the creative destruction. We need a carbon tax, to give everyone an incentive to reduce carbon emissions without pretending we know the best way to do it.\nEvery single idea I just mentioned comes from the American Enterprise Institute or Brookings or some other institution derided as being part of the neoliberal elite. All these ideas would make capitalism work better.\nA big mistake those of us on the conservative side made was to think that anything that made the government bigger also made the market less dynamic. We failed to distinguish between the supportive state and the regulatory state. The supportive state makes better and more secure capitalists. The Scandinavian nations have very supportive welfare states. They also have very free markets. The only reason they can afford to have generous welfare states is they also have very free markets.\nI don't know if the Scandinavian welfare model would work in nations as big and diverse as the U.S. But its success points to a few truths: The state nurtures prosperity when it helps people become capitalists. The state causes incredible levels of misery when it gets too far inside the decision-making processes of capitalists. It creates enormous misery when it cripples the motivational system that drives capitalism. It causes enormous misery when it meddles with the relentless learning system that market mechanisms make possible.\nCapitalism is not a religion. It won't save your soul or fulfill the yearnings of your heart. But somehow it will arouse your energies, it will lift your sights, it will put you on a lifelong learning journey to know, to improve, to dare and to dare again.\nLast Sunday I attended a service with a young friend at a church that has quickly become a home for her. There were several hundred congregants. Ninety percent were under 30. Ninety percent were Latino. The service was two hours of joy and exultation \u2014 glow sticks and song and balloons.\nThey weren't worshiping capitalism, but something higher. But still their work lives came into view. \"Look how far we've come! Look how far we've come!\" different people kept saying. I saw my own family's Jewish immigration history being re-enacted right in front of me. We, like they, started out as butchers and seamstresses and tailors, self-employed capitalists because it can be hard for immigrants to get corporate jobs. The opportunity explosion my family experienced and your family probably experienced is happening still, made possible by the ever-expanding pie that capitalism provides.\nThe theme that day was hope, transcendent hope and more immediate hope. \"Move and miracles happen!\" a young Latino woman sang. Every year, hundreds of millions of people march with their feet to capitalism.\nToday, the real argument is not between capitalism and socialism. We ran that social experiment for 100 years and capitalism won. It's between a version of democratic capitalism, found in the U.S., Canada and Denmark, and forms of authoritarian capitalism, found in China and Russia. Our job is to make it the widest and fairest version of capitalism it can possibly be."}, {"idx": 73, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/28/opinion/brain-body-thinking.html", "text": "This has been a golden age for brain research. We now have amazing brain scans that show which networks in the brain ramp up during different activities. But this emphasis on the brain has subtly fed the illusion that thinking happens only from the neck up. It's fed the illusion that the advanced parts of our thinking are the \"rational\" parts up top that try to control the more \"primitive\" parts down below.\nSo it's interesting how many scientists are now focusing on the thinking that happens not in your brain but in your gut. You have neurons spread through your innards, and there's increasing attention on the vagus nerve, which emerges from the brain stem and wanders across the heart, lungs, kidney and gut.\nThe vagus nerve is one of the pathways through which the body and brain talk to each other in an unconscious conversation. Much of this conversation is about how we are relating to others. Human thinking is not primarily about individual calculation, but about social engagement and cooperation.\nOne of the leaders in this field is Stephen W. Porges of Indiana University. When you enter a new situation, Porges argues, your body reacts. Your heart rate may go up. Your blood pressure may change. Signals go up to the brain, which records the \"autonomic state\" you are in.\nMaybe you walk into a social situation that feels welcoming. Green light. Your brain and body get prepared for a friendly conversation. But maybe the person in front of you feels threatening. Yellow light. You go into fight-or-flight mode. Your body instantly changes. Your ear, for example, adjusts to hear high and low frequencies \u2014 a scream or a growl \u2014 rather than midrange frequencies, human speech. Or maybe the threat feels like a matter of life and death. Red light. Your brain and body begin to shut down.\nAccording to Porges's \"Polyvagal Theory,\" the concept of safety is fundamental to our mental state. People who have experienced trauma have bodies that are highly reactive to perceived threat. They don't like public places with loud noises. They live in fight-or-flight mode, stressed and anxious. Or, if they feel trapped and constrained, they go numb. Their voice and tone go flat. Physical reactions shape our way of seeing and being.\nLisa Feldman Barrett, of Northeastern University, also argues that a main purpose of the brain is to read the body, and to regulate what she calls the body budget. You may see a bully on the playground. Your brain then predicts your next action and speeds your heart rate and breathing to deal with it. You experience these changes as emotion \u2014 oh, this is fear or oh, this is anger \u2014 because your brain has created an emotion concept to make those physical changes meaningful.\n\"You might think that in everyday life, the things you see and hear influence what you feel, but it's mostly the other way around: What you feel alters your sight and hearing,\" Barrett writes in \"How Emotions Are Made.\"\nWhen we're really young we know few emotion concepts. Young children say, \"Mommy, I hate you!\" when they mean \"I don't like this\" because they haven't learned their culture's concepts for hatred vs. badness. But as we get older we learn more emotional granularity. The emotionally wise person can create distinct experiences of disappointment, anger, spite, resentment, grouchiness and aggravation, whereas for a less emotionally wise person those are all synonyms for \"I feel bad.\"\nA wise person may know the foreign words that express emotions we can't name in English: tocka (Russian, roughly, for spiritual anguish) or litost (Czech, roughly, for misery combined with the hunger for revenge). People with high emotional granularity respond flexibly to life, have better mental health outcomes and drink less.\nIf bodily reactions can drive people apart they can also heal. Martha G. Welch of Columbia University points to the importance of loving physical touch, especially in the first 1,000 minutes of life, to lay down markers of emotional stability.\nUnder the old brain-only paradigm, Welch argues, we told people to self-regulate their emotions through conscious self-talk. But real emotional help comes through co-regulation. When a mother and a child physically hold each other, their bodily autonomic states harmonize, connecting on a metabolic level. Together they move from separate distress to mutual calm.\nWelch has created something called the Welch Emotional Connection Screen, which measures the emotional connection between mothers and pre-term babies. By encouraging this kind of deep visceral connection through 18 months, her therapy can mitigate the effects of autism.\nWhen you step back and see the brain and body thinking together, the old distinction between reason and emotion doesn't seem to make sense. Your very perception of the world is shaped by the predictions your brain is making about your physical autonomic states.\nYou also see how important it is to teach emotional granularity, something our culture pays almost no attention to.\nYou also see that we're not separate brains, coolly observing each other. We're physical viscera, deeply interacting with each other. The important communication is happening at a much deeper level."}, {"idx": 74, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/opinion/populism-protests.html", "text": "Have you noticed that the world is on fire? \nCrowds are chanting \"Death to Khamenei\" in Iran while the regime kills them en masse and shuts down the internet. Throngs are marching to preserve democratic rights in Hong Kong, Warsaw, Budapest, Istanbul and Moscow. The masses are angry in Pakistan, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia and toppling leaders in Lebanon and Bolivia. \nThis is the most widespread surge in global civic unrest since 1989. It's a story 10 times bigger than impeachment, although the two are related.\nThe seeds of today's unrest were planted in those events of 30 years ago \u2014 the fall of the Soviet Union, the spread of globalization and all the rest. That was the heyday of liberal democratic capitalism, free market fundamentalism, the end of history.\nWe all know now what many of us didn't appreciate then: Globalized democratic capitalism was going to spark a backlash. It led to growing economic and cultural clashes between the educated urbanites, who thrived, and the rural masses, who were left behind. It was too spiritually thin, too cosmopolitan and deracinated. People felt that their national cultures were being ripped away from them.\nThe populist backlash came in different forms in different parts of the world. In Central and Eastern Europe it came in the form of nationalist strongmen \u2014 Victor Orban, Vladimir Putin, the Law and Justice party in Poland. In Latin America it came in the form of the Pink Tide \u2014 a group of left-wing economic populists like Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. In the Anglosphere it was white ethnic nationalism of Donald Trump and Brexit. In the Middle East it was Muslim fundamentalism. In China it was the increasing authoritarianism of Xi Jinping. In India it was the Hindu nationalism of Narendra Modi.\nIn places, the populist wave is still rising. The Yellow Vests in France and the protests in Chile are led by those who feel economically left behind. But it's also clear that when in power the populists can't deliver goods. So now in many places we're seeing a revolt against the revolt, urban middle-class uprisings against the populists themselves.\nThe core problem is economic. Populist economic policies of left and right destroy growth. Venezuela is an economic disaster. In Mexico the left-wing populist policies of Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador have brought growth to a halt. The International Monetary Fund projects Latin American growth could fall to 0.2 percent.\nLebanon is creating only 3,000 jobs a year, when it needs at least 20,000. Meanwhile, debt has soared. Trump's trade war has lowered American economic dynamism. Xi has walked away from market reforms and ushered in an economic slowdown. Under the tax-hiking populist leader Imran Khan in Pakistan, car sales fell 39 percent in the latest quarter.\nAll across the world, members of the new middle classes feel trapped and abandoned. As Fareed Zakaria noted recently, the I.M.F. sees a world economy that is in a \"synchronized slowdown\" and growing at \"its slowest pace since the global financial crisis.\"\nThe second thing the populists have brought is corruption. Trump's quid pro quo attempt with Ukraine is of a piece with the corrupt practices ushered in by populists all around the world. They vowed to smash the rules, but it turns out it was mostly for self-enrichment and self-protection. \nEvo Morales stands accused of trying to rig an election in Bolivia. Former Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri gave $16 million to a bikini model while his countrymen were scraping by. In the U.S., Washington insiders are rising up to curtail Trump's normlessness. Data from the Corruption Perceptions Index show that people around the world feel that corruption is on the rise.\nThe populist/authoritarian regimes are losing legitimacy. The members of the urban middle class in places like Hong Kong and Indonesia are rising up to protect the political and social freedoms.\nThese days, it doesn't take much to set off a giant wave of anger. In Lebanon it was a proposed tax on WhatsApp. In Saudi Arabia the government raised taxes on hookah restaurants. In France, Zimbabwe, Ecuador and Iran it was rising fuel prices. In Chile it was a proposed 4 percent rise in subway fares. \nThe world is unsteady and ready to blow. The overall message is that the flaws of liberal globalization are real, but the populist alternative is not working.\nThe protests in all these places are leaderless, so it's unrealistic to expect them to have policy agendas. But the big question is, what's next? What comes after the failure of populism?\nThe big job ahead for leaders in almost all these nations is this: Write a new social contract that gives both the educated urban elites and the heartland working classes a piece of what they want most.\nThe working classes who have been supporting populists need a way to thrive in the modern economy and a sense they are respected contributors to their national project. The educated elites want their democratic freedoms protected and to live in ethnically diverse pluralistic societies.\nWhoever can write that social bargain wins the future."}, {"idx": 75, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/opinion/taylor-kent-impeachment-hearings.html", "text": "Let me tell you a secret. The public buildings of Washington are filled with very good people working hard for low pay and the public good. There are thousands of them and they are very much like the Foreign Service officers that we've seen or are expected to see testifying at the impeachment hearings: William Taylor, George Kent, Marie Yovanovitch and Fiona Hill.\nThese public servants tend to be self-effacing and deeply knowledgeable about some small realm of public policy. They're generally not all that interested in partisan politics but are deeply committed to the process and substance of good government. Whenever I get to sit in on off-the-record meetings at this or that federal agency, I'm impressed by the quality, professionalism and basic goodness of the people there.\nWe don't celebrate these people. Trumpian conservatives say that Washington insiders are unelected bureaucrats, denizens of the swamp, the cesspool or a snake pit. Some progressives call Washington insiders the establishment, the power elite, the privileged structures of the status quo.\nEverybody who runs for office wants to be seen as an outsider and condemns the insiders. That is, until weeks like this one when we realize how much we need them.\nAt this week's hearings, the civil servant witnesses answering questions inspired a lot more confidence than the elected officials who were asking them.  Why are they so impressive? It's precisely because they are Washington insiders. The witnesses have worked in a long line of institutions \u2014 the State Department, the World Bank, the Brookings Institution, the National Security Council.\nFor all their flaws, these institutions possess what the political scientist Hugh Heclo called \"sedimented deposits\" of inherited knowledge. If you are a Foreign service officer long enough, you learn to think like a Foreign Service officer. You absorb the skills, practices and moral codes you need to do the work well. When someone breaks the code, you know immediately, and if you are brave enough, like the whistle-blower, you move to defend the code.\nWhen public servants enter government, they shed their private interests to serve a public role. A great question of the Trump years is whether our institutions can survive a president who is incapable of thinking outside his own private interest. Donald Trump uses public office as a gold mine to extract personal advantage.\nAs Yuval Levin writes in his profound forthcoming book, \"A Time to Build,\" Trump is an example of a person who wasn't formed by an institution. He is self-created and self-enclosed. He governs as a perpetual outsider, tweeting insults to members of his own cabinet. At its best, the impeachment process is an attempt to protect our institutions from his inability to obey the rules.\nThe wider disease here is \"outsiderism\" itself. For a half-century our culture has celebrated the rebel, not the organization man; the free individual, not the institutionalist. That's fine and in many cases good, but over the decades this outsider pose has hardened into an immature cynicism: Everybody's corrupt. No one is to be trusted.\n\"The populism of this moment in our politics is fundamentally antinomian, mistrustful of authority, and cynical about all claims to integrity,\" Levin writes in \"A Time to Build.\" \"Our age combines a populism that insists all of our institutions are rigged against the people with an identity politics that rejects institutional commitments and a celebrity culture that chafes against all structure and constraint.\"\nAll around the world voters are electing comedians, celebrities and outsider performers to high office. All around the world people are responding to demagogues who tell them that our problems are easy to solve if we just get rid of the bad people. Everywhere rule-breakers like Trump, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Nicol\u00e1s Maduro are in power and corruption is in the air.\nPeople have messed-up theories of how you do social change. On the right many think that you need to elect some authoritarian strongman who will whip everybody into shape. On the left many put their faith in social movements, without explaining how social movements are going to write and pass legislation.\nIn reality, institutions are the only vehicles for legislative change. That's because they are the way to wield power safely. They have rules and structures and norms precisely because power is so dangerous when it is wielded by a lone strongman or by a mob.\nPeople have lost faith in institutions for some very good reasons, and the need to reform them is urgent. But the disenchantment is overblown and self-destructive. We don't pay enough attention to all the planes that take off and land safely. We underestimate the value of experience. As Heclo writes in \"On Thinking Institutionally,\" \"It is when you deal with someone who does not perform in a 'professional' manner that you learn to appreciate those who do.\"\nWatching Taylor and Kent, I had a feeling of going back in time. Why did it feel so strange? It was because I was looking at people who are not self-centered. They've dedicated themselves to the organization that formed them, and which they serve."}, {"idx": 76, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/opinion/trump-immigration.html", "text": "A wave of anxiety swept through Democratic ranks this week when a Times/Siena College poll suggested that Donald Trump is leading key Democrats in a bunch of swing states. How the heck is this guy still doing so well out there, after all that has happened?\nThe short answer is: immigration. Trump, like global populists everywhere, understands that we're in the middle of a vast social experiment. Waves of migration are transforming societies across the globe. The U.S. will have no majority group in three decades. Sweden could be between 20 and 30 percent Muslim by 2050, according to Pew Research projections.\nAs the saying goes, everybody is now everywhere. We're entering into states of interdependence with all sorts of people unlike ourselves. In the course of this, millions of people perceive that they are losing their country, losing their place, losing their culture.\nTrump, like global populists everywhere, tells them: I'll help you regain control.\nBy contrast, highly educated white progressives tell them: If you want to restrict immigration you're probably a racist. As Eric Kaufmann notes in his book \"Whiteshift,\" 91.3 percent of white Hillary Clinton voters with graduate degrees said it's racist to want less immigration for ethnic and cultural reasons.\nTrump then turns around and says: See? These liberal elites want to silence you! They think you're bigots! Game over.\nIf Trump opponents want to reach these voters, they need a better answer to one of the central challenges of our age: how to create a mass multicultural democracy where people feel at home.\nThis week I was at a Faith Angle Forum conference in France with a group of European and American scholars and journalists. I got a glimpse of that better answer. \nThe Europeans reminded me of something that is taboo here: that immigration is always, at the most personal level, a cultural encounter. It's a person with one language and set of values interacting with a person with another language and set of values. When people meet in this way, they put their opinions, identities and way of life at risk. They might be changed by the encounter. The process is unsettling.\nThe crucial question becomes: Do the people in the encounter feel secure enough to learn from it rather than to react with anxiety and fear? Right now, we are asking millions of Americans to accept high immigration while they are already living with maximum insecurity. Their wages are declining, their families and communities are fragmenting, their churches are shrinking, government services are being cut, their values and national identity feel unstable. \nOf course they are going to react with suspicion if suddenly on top of all this they begin to feel like strangers in their own place.\nThe lesson is that to create thick pluralistic society, you first have to help people embed in a secure base. That includes economic and health care security, but it also involves cultural and spiritual security. It involves offering people opportunities to embed in their local culture, to practice their particular faith, to live by local values that may seem alien to you and me. \nOnly people who are securely rooted in their own particularity are confident enough to enjoy the encounter with difference.\nThis is the paradox of pluralism: In order to get people to integrate with others you have to help them weave close communities with their own kind. Cosmopolitans never get this.\nA person who is firmly rooted can go out and enjoy the adventure of pluralism. This is the second phase of thick pluralism. The person with the pluralist mind-set acknowledges that God's truth is radically dispersed. It is not contained in one tradition and community. The good life is only understood through a holistic journey across traditions.\nThe pluralist doesn't see society as a competition for scarce resources, but as a joint voyage of discovery in search of life's biggest answers. Pluralism offers us the chance, and the civic duty, to be a daring social explorer, venturing across subcultures, sometimes having the exciting experience of being the only one of you in the room, harvesting the wisdom embedded in other people's lifeways. A key pluralist trait is curiosity, the opposite of anxiety.\nSocial exploration is a skill. It requires the ability to not merely tolerate difference, but to greet it with a generosity of spirit. Walking into each room confident in your convictions but humbly aware that they are not the only convictions. Being slow to take offense when somebody says the wrong thing, quick to forget the transgressions of others and honest in acknowledging your group's past wrongs.\nThe conversations at the Faith Angle Forum reminded me that in a pluralistic society, institutions like schools, companies and neighborhoods have to be structured to offer both kinds of experience: bonding experience within your own tradition to create rootedness and also bridging experience that offers journeys of curiosity across different moral ecosystems.\nConservatives tend to emphasize the value of being rooted in place. Progressives tend to celebrate living across difference. Life is miserable, and a nation is broken, unless you do both."}, {"idx": 77, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/opinion/trump-impeachment.html", "text": "Is it possible that more than 20 Republican senators will vote to convict Donald Trump of articles of impeachment? When you hang around Washington you get the sense that it could happen.\nThe evidence against Trump is overwhelming. This Ukraine quid pro quo wasn't just a single reckless phone call. It was a multiprong several-month campaign to use the levers of American power to destroy a political rival.\nRepublican legislators are being bludgeoned with this truth in testimony after testimony. They know in their hearts that Trump is guilty of impeachable offenses. It's evident in the way they stare glumly at their desks during hearings; the way they flee reporters seeking comment; the way they slag the White House off the record. It'll be hard for them to vote to acquit if they can't even come up with a non-ludicrous rationale.\nAnd yet when you get outside Washington it's hard to imagine more than one or two G.O.P. senators voting to convict.\nIn the first place, Democrats have not won widespread public support. Nancy Pelosi always said impeachment works only if there's a bipartisan groundswell, and so far there is not. Trump's job approval numbers have been largely unaffected by the impeachment inquiry. Support for impeachment breaks down on conventional pro-Trump/anti-Trump lines. Roughly 90 percent of Republican voters oppose it. Republican senators will never vote to convict in the face of that.\nSecond, Democrats have not won over the most important voters \u2014 moderates in swing states. A New York Times/Siena College survey of voters in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin found that just 43 percent want to impeach and remove Trump from office, while 53 percent do not. Pushing impeachment makes Democrats vulnerable in precisely the states they cannot afford to lose in 2020.\nThird, there is little prospect these numbers will turn around, even after a series of high-profile hearings.\nI've been traveling pretty constantly since this impeachment thing got going. I've been to a bunch of blue states and a bunch of red states (including Kansas, Missouri, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Utah). In coastal blue states, impeachment comes up in conversation all the time. In red states, it never comes up; ask people in red states if they've been talking about it with their friends, they shrug and reply no, not really.\nProf. Paul Sracic of Youngstown State University in Ohio told Ken Stern from Vanity Fair that when he asked his class of 80 students if they'd heard any conversation about impeachment, only two said they had. When he asked if impeachment interested them, all 80 said it did not.\nThat's exactly what I've found, too. For most, impeachment is not a priority. It's a dull background noise \u2014 people in Washington and the national media doing the nonsense they always do. A pollster can ask Americans if they support impeachment, and some yes or no answer will be given, but the fundamental reality is that many Americans are indifferent.\nFourth, it's a lot harder to do impeachment in an age of cynicism, exhaustion and distrust. During Watergate, voters trusted federal institutions and granted the impeachment process a measure of legitimacy. Today's voters do not share that trust and will not regard an intra-Washington process as legitimate.\nMany Americans don't care about impeachment because they take it as a given that this is the kind of corruption that politicians of all stripes have been doing all along. Many don't care because it looks like the same partisan warfare that's been going on forever, just with a different name.\nFifth, it's harder to do impeachment when politics is seen as an existential war for the future of the country. Many Republicans know Trump is guilty, but they can't afford to hand power to Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders. \nProgressives, let me ask you a question: If Trump-style Republicans were trying to impeach a President Biden, Warren or Sanders, and there was evidence of guilt, would you vote to convict? Answer honestly.\nI get that Democrats feel they have to proceed with impeachment to protect the Constitution and the rule of law. But there is little chance they will come close to ousting the president. So I hope they set a Thanksgiving deadline. Play the impeachment card through November, have the House vote and then move on to other things. The Senate can quickly dispose of the matter and Democratic candidates can make their best pitches for denying Trump re-election.\nElizabeth Bruenig of The Washington Post put her finger on something important in a recent essay on Trump's evangelical voters: the assumption of decline. Many Trump voters take it as a matter of course that for the rest of their lives things are going to get worse for them \u2014 economically, spiritually, politically and culturally. They are not the only voters who think this way. Many young voters in their OK Boomer T-shirts feel exactly the same, except about climate change, employment prospects and debt.\nThis sense of elite negligence in the face of national decline is the core issue right now. Impeachment is a distraction from that. As quickly as possible, it's time to move on.\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We'd like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips. And here's our email: letters@nytimes.com."}, {"idx": 78, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/opinion/tipping.html", "text": "For most of my life I've been glad that America is a society that relies heavily on tipping. First, tipping allows us to reward excellent service. Second, in a world of rising economic inequality, a 30 to 50 percent tip is a small but direct way to redistribute money to those who are working hard to earn a living.\nMoreover, tipping nurtures humane relationships. It encourages servers to try to establish social connection through direct eye contact and a display of warmth. Finally, most of the servers I've known like the tipping system. They've believed that by doing their job well they could earn far more than they could through a flat wage. That's certainly what I thought as a bartender.\nSo over all, I've taken it as good news that tipping culture seems to be spreading to every cashier's counter in the land.\nBut if you look at the research you find that a lot of it doesn't buttress my priors. In the first place, the amount of a tip is rarely related to the quality of the service. Michael Lynn of Cornell, who is the leading scholar on the subject, finds that the quality of the service has a relatively small effect on tip size.\nWhat matters most is the size of the check. If you want bigger tips, induce your customers to order more. The second thing that matters is the customer. A survey of 40 million Uber trips found that men tip more often than women and people in the middle of the country tip better than people on the coasts. The identity of the customer matters more than the quality of the service.\nIn short, the meritocratic argument for tipping falls apart. Then there are all the downsides:\nTipping inflames a sexist dynamic. Some men use their tips as leverage to harass female servers. Young blond women are tipped more than older brunettes. Male Uber riders tip female drivers 12 percent more, but only if they are young.\nTipping inflames a racist dynamic. African-American and Latino servers get much smaller tips. In a 2005 study of more than 1,000 tips to taxi drivers in New Haven, black drivers were tipped about a third less than white drivers.\nTipping widens class divisions. Servers who work in upscale restaurants can make good money. Servers who work in diners struggle. The people who work in the front of the restaurant might do well; those who work in the back do not. Many people think the very custom of tipping is a demeaning remnant from the age of aristocracy.\nThe conclusion from this is that in an ideal world, it would be a good idea to move to the French model: \"service compris.\"\nBut we live in actual America. In actual America, efforts to eliminate tipping have generally failed. Voters in Maine and Washington, D.C., passed ballot measures to phase out tipping. Both decisions were overturned after protest and confusion. Restaurants that move away from tipping often backtrack.\nThat's in part because consumers have sticker shock when they see the 20 percent tip cost included in the menu prices. It's also in part because customers like the tipping experience. If restaurants take it away, diners perceive that the service is worse, and the Yelp scores will go down. Such restaurants also have trouble retaining staff members.\nSo when you're thinking about compensating servers, it's best to start from the assumption that tipping will be around for a while. The smart thing to ask is, how can we make the best of a bad situation?\nWhich brings us to the real reason I'm writing this column. It is common these days to think that the way to do political and social change is: Think of the ideal system, then move to that. But the better way to make social change is: Think of the ideal system, then get as close as you can, given the restraints of human nature, and our own situation.\nThomas Sowell's outstanding book \"A Conflict of Visions\" explores the virtues of working realistically within constraints, and the evils that ensue when people ignore or try to run roughshod over them. He would say the constrained vision is wiser whether the subject is tipping, expanding health insurance or choosing between capitalism and socialism.\nIn the unconstrained vision, you ask: What's the solution? In a constrained vision you ask: What's the best set of trade-offs and reforms we can actually achieve?\nThe constrained vision is wiser. So I'll cheer on those who want to move America to a no-tip system. In the meantime, there are ways we can all make the best of a bad system:"}, {"idx": 79, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/opinion/trump-warren-2020.html", "text": "This is a memo for the politically homeless. It's a memo to those of us who could never support Donald Trump but think the Bernie-Squad-Warren Democratic Party is sprinting too far left. It's a memo built around the following question: If the general election campaign turns out to be Trump vs. Warren, what the heck are we supposed to do?\nThe first thing we could do, of course, is pray for a miracle. Maybe the Democrats will nominate one of the five B's or the K: Biden, Buttigieg, Booker, Bennet, Bullock or Klobuchar.\nThese candidates are pluralists, not purists. They make many voters who disagree with them feel heard and respected. They practice the craft of politics, building majority coalitions to get things done.\nIf the party nominated one of those six, you really could see the Democrats gather progressives and moderates into an enduring majority coalition as the Republicans recede into old, white, rural obsolescence. You could see movement on a range of issues where large majorities are already stacked on one side: guns, climate change, reducing income inequality, expanding health coverage.\n[The big debates, distilled. This guide will put in context what people are saying about the pressing issues of the week. Sign up for our new newsletter, Debatable.]\nBut right now, Elizabeth Warren has the momentum, and so those of us who feel politically homeless may face a stark choice.\nFor many, supporting Warren is too high a price to pay, even for ousting Trump. \"There is no universe where I will ever vote for Donald Trump, and there is no universe where I could ever vote for Elizabeth Warren,\" Jennifer Horn, a former chairwoman of the New Hampshire G.O.P., told The Washington Examiner.\nAnd you can see why so many people have that reaction.\nFirst, there are Warren's policies. On trade, she's a protectionist. Her 10-year, $34 trillion health care plan isn't paid for. Her student debt cancellation plan is a handout to the upper middle class. Her campaign seems to not acknowledge the inevitable trade-off between economic growth and high spending, high taxes and high regulation.\nSecond, she's one of the few Democrats who could actually lose. As Yascha Mounk notes in The Atlantic, Democrats won in 2018 because they won back a lot of nonpartisan suburban office park workers who found moderates they could vote for. When you remind independents of Democratic support for abolishing private health insurance and decriminalizing unauthorized border crossing \u2014 two key Warren policies \u2014 they become six percentage points less likely to vote for the Democrats. Trump will tell voters: You may despise me, but she'll destroy the economy.\nThird, a Warren presidency would be deeply polarizing and probably unsuccessful. Warren's policy ideas would make any progressive-moderate coalition impossible. She'd try to govern with her 40 percent partisan base, just as Trump has, which is no way to pass big legislation.\nFourth, there is a wave of insular intolerance coursing through parts of the American left. If given executive power, some progressives may use it to cancel any culture or faith other than their own.\nAnd yet \u2026.\nAnd yet, if it comes to Trump vs. Warren in a general election, the only plausible choice is to support Warren. Over the past month Donald Trump has given us fresh reminders of the unique and exceptional ways he corrupts American life. You're either part of removing that corruption or you are not. When your nation's political system is in danger, staying home and not voting is not a responsible option.\nPolitics is downstream from morality and culture. Warren represents a policy wrong turn, in my view, but policies can be argued about and reversed. Trump represents a much more important and fundamental threat \u2014 to the norms, values, standards and soul of this country. \nLast week, Trump all but greenlighted the ethnic cleansing of Kurds without an ounce of remorse. He normalizes dishonesty and valorizes cruelty. His letter to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reminds us yet again that we have a president whose professional competence is at kindergarten level. Once a nation has lost its heart, mind and soul, it is very hard to get these things back.\nFurthermore, Trump is an unprecedented threat to democratic institutions. Over the past few years, I've thought the progressive fears of incipient American fascism were vastly overblown. But, especially over the past month, Trump has worked overtime to validate those fears and to raise the horrifying specter of what he'll be like if he is given a second term and is vindicated, unhinged and unwell.\nIn their book \"How Democracies Die,\" Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt argue that authoritarians undermine democracy in several ways. They reject the democratic rules of the game, the unwritten norms we rely upon to make the political system work. They deny the legitimacy of their political opponents, using extreme language to deny them standing as co-citizens. They tolerate or even encourage violence, threatening to take legal action against critics in rival parties.\nTrump has been guilty of all three sins, and given a second term he will feel free to stomp where up until now he has merely trod.\nThis election is about whether we can hold together as a functioning nation, across our economic, racial, geographic and ideological divides. In such circumstances, a bad option is better than a suicidal one."}, {"idx": 80, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/opinion/frederick-douglass-detroit.html", "text": "Around New Year's 2017, a community organizer named Chris Lambert leased a soon-to-be-empty school building for $1 in one of Detroit's poorer African-American neighborhoods. The plan was to pour $5 million into remodeling the building, take on the $1-million-a-year operating expenses and turn the place into a vibrant hub for the surrounding community, with nonprofits, culinary training programs, after-school programs and artists.\nLambert did not communicate this well to the people who actually lived in the community.\nWhen neighbors learned Lambert had acquired the building for a dollar, many wondered why a white outsider, not somebody from within the community, had gotten such a deal. They assumed that he was the cutting edge of gentrification, that he was going to pour money in and push the current folks out. This kind of outsider exploitation is the lived history for many Detroiters.\nThat month, Lambert hosted some community meetings to mollify fears. They did not go well. People called him a colonizer. They called his black colleagues Oreos. \"This white guy is going to subject us to more slavery,\" somebody declared.\nLambert wanted to argue back. But his black partner, Dwan Dandridge, advised him to just listen. It's a hazing process, Dandridge told Lambert. You feel voiceless tonight. These people have felt voiceless their whole lives. Just listen.\nThis fullest account of the episode can be found in Bittersweet Monthly in an article written by Anne Snyder, my wife. I visited Lambert and Dandridge in Detroit a few weeks ago, a year and a half after the grand opening.\nThe building, now called the Durfee Innovation Society, has children teeming the halls, a pizzeria, training programs, yoga classes. Lambert is humbled by the mistakes he made, but his center is fantastic. Some of his angriest critics have now taken part in neighborhood festivities held in the building. There is still distrust, suspicion, rage at injustice coursing through the neighborhood. But there is also life together, happening every day.\nI see these messy clash-ups across the country, wherever people are trying to do racial reconciliation. You realize that coming together across race is not a neat two-step process: truth and reconciliation. It's an emotionally complex, thousand-step process, with moments of miscommunication, resentment and embrace. This is the hard process of trying to see each other across centuries of wrong.\nThe somewhat comforting truth is that it's always been like this. When you read David Blight's brilliant biography of Frederick Douglass, for example, you see that Douglass passed through exactly these many moods in dealing with his countrymen of another race \u2014 moments of fury and harmony, despair and hope.\nSometimes he was disgusted with America. \"I have no love for America, as such,\" he once said. Other times he was enraptured: \"I am an American citizen. In birth, in sentiment, in ideas, in hopes, in aspirations and responsibilities.\"\nDouglass's genius was his ability to balance his indignation at oppression with his underlying faith in the American project. In his speeches he would praise his white audiences in one movement and thunder condemnation in the next. In an 1876 speech about Abraham Lincoln, he both condemned and complimented the man who inspired and infuriated him: \"Viewed from the genuine abolition ground, Mr. Lincoln seemed tardy, cold, dull and indifferent; but measuring him from the sentiment of his country \u2026 he was swift, zealous, radical and determined.\"\nDouglass could withstand all the ups and downs, all the ambivalences, because of an unchanging underlying belief: in the natural rights of all humankind.\nHe constantly returned to the core belief of America's founding in 1776, that we are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights. Slavery and racism were not just wrong \u2014 they betrayed the divine natural order of the universe. Douglass had an underlying faith in the providence. Justice would eventually triumph. The \"laws which govern the moral universe,\" he said, would make it so.\nAnd here we get to the nub of what sustained Douglass and what sustains people today as they do this work. It is the belief that all humans have souls. It is the belief that all people of all races have a piece of themselves that has no size, weight, color or shape, but which gives them infinite value and dignity.\nIt is the belief that our souls make us all radically equal. Our brains and bodies are not equal, but our souls are. It is the belief that the person who is infuriating you most right now still has a soul and so is still, deep down, beautiful and redeemable. It is the belief that when all is said and done all souls have a common home together, a final resting place as pieces of a larger unity.\nWhen people hold fast to their awareness of souls, then they have a fixed center among the messiness of racial reconciliation and they give each other grace. If they lose the concept of the soul, they've lost everything."}], "Paul Krugman": [{"idx": 81, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/07/opinion/trade-trump-china.html", "text": "\"Trump's trade war is losing, not gaining, support,\" Paul Krugman wrote this week in his column \"Why Is Trump a Tariff Man?\" So why does the president avoid making the deals that might end this perpetual state of economic uncertainty? In a word, freedom. \n\"Tariffs let him exercise unconstrained power, rewarding his friends and punishing his enemies,\" Krugman continued.\nReaders had questions: Other than tariffs, how could the United States encourage other countries to adopt better trade practices? What's the effect on foreign policy relations? Could electing a new administration reverse damage?\nAny silver lining is a long way off, according to Krugman. \"To really get back on track, we'd need a defeat \u2014 not just of Trump but also of Trumpism, which would take multiple elections,\" he wrote in response to one reader.\nThat exchange, and others, are below. They've been edited for length and clarity. \u2014 Rachel L. Harris and Lisa Tarchak, senior editorial assistants\nVitor, Greensboro, N.C.: I fully agree that tariffs are bad, there are no winners. However, these tariffs can also be of some use to control unfair trade practices (labor, environment and other issues). Other than tariffs, how could we influence other countries to adopt better trade and industrial practices? \nPaul Krugman: It's O.K. to link trade policy to other goals, as long as it's transparent and consistent with a rules-based system. The North American Free Trade Agreement actually contains labor-rights conditions, although they haven't been well enforced. \nIn the past, I've supported tariffs to counter Chinese currency manipulation \u2014 which was a real issue circa 2010, but isn't now \u2014 and carbon tariffs in support of climate policy if we ever do impose carbon taxes or cap and trade here. Basically, the threat of tariffs can be used to induce other countries to play by the rules; but we can't do that unless we ourselves are playing by the rules!\nMeggan Dissly, Paris: All of the business people I know appreciate that Trump is standing up to China \u2014 the first president to do so \u2014 and they approve. Is it possible that he is on the right track as far as China is concerned but completely off base with other countries like Canada, France and Brazil? \nKrugman: None of the businesspeople I know think that. China is a bad actor in some ways, especially in not respecting intellectual property and arguably in de facto subsidizing some industries. But Trump isn't taking on China over those issues, and hasn't even made any clear demands. \nHe also hasn't rallied other countries to join America in pressing China to change. Instead, he's picking fights with everyone. So even if you think China should be confronted, Trump is doing it wrong.\nMichael Wilson, Boulder, Colo.: Peter Navarro (assistant to the president and director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy) makes the claim that Americans are not incurring much increase in costs from tariffs on goods from China because China is devaluing its currency in order to offset any such increase. In this way, it's China that's paying the cost of the tariffs. To what extent is that true? \nKrugman: We have numbers on this! If China were bearing the tariff, the price of imports to the United States from China would be falling a lot. They aren't. All the evidence says that United States consumers are bearing the tariffs, and that Navarro is just making stuff up.\nBarbara De Matteo, Setauket-East Setauket, N.Y.: Does anyone look at his family's investment moves when Trump makes these trade announcements? I am curious about the impact on their wealth when he makes these seemingly arbitrary announcements. I wonder if this is all one big strategy for him. \nKrugman: Everything suggests that Trump is using his office to enrich himself. But I think it's a lot cruder than that \u2014 more about extortion (don't expect any favors unless you book my hotels) than stock market manipulation. It's a sort of corruption Occam's razor: never assume sophistication when crude thuggery is sufficient.\nJan Saver, Brussels: Is it possible to put a value on certainty \u2014 or uncertainty? \nAdditionally, I think there is a significant cost attached to giving up the rules-based trading system, which the United States should try to factor in. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and World Trade Organization rules have kept trade conflicts from escalating (tit-for-tat tariffs or, worse, wars). The brakes now seem to be off.\nKrugman: Really hard to put a number on it, but given what has happened to business investment despite huge tax cuts, it looks as if the costs are pretty big. As I said in the column, the costs of the trade war have surprised even those of us who opposed Trump's policies.\nRickard Waern, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden: What are the ramifications of Trump's trade war on the global economy? Is there a risk of recession? \nKrugman: The trade war is hurting, but nothing I see is big enough to produce a global recession, at least so far. At worst, it's a contributing factor to a bunch of other things that may be weakening the world economy \u2014 nothing remotely on the scale of, say, the late 2000s housing bust. \nThose other things, by the way, include a Chinese slowdown that some of us have been predicting for years and finally seems to be happening; the troubles of Europe, which have a lot to do with a drastic slowdown of population growth; and, maybe, shifts in United States business that have moved us toward technology companies that don't need to do a lot of physical investment. Again, on their own, none of these things are huge, but collectively they add up.\nBob Sharak, Chesapeake, Va.: How difficult will it be to unwind the damage Trump has done in just this one area? Is it realistic to say that it could be fixed in one or two presidential terms? \nKrugman: I don't think we'll ever reverse the damage. We can fix some things, but neither countries nor businesses will ever go back to believing that United States trade policy can be counted on to be predictable or that we will honor our commitments. Even once Trump is gone, the possibility that America will elect another leader like him will shadow everything for decades to come. \nTo really get back on track, we'd need a defeat \u2014 not just of Trump but also of Trumpism, which would take multiple elections. Remember how Obama's victory was supposed to change everything? We're going to need an extended period \u2014 maybe three presidential elections in a row \u2014 that makes it clear that voters are insisting on politicians who care about the rule of law."}, {"idx": 82, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/opinion/climate-change-republicans.html", "text": "The most terrifying aspect of the U.S. political drama isn't the revelation that the president has abused his power for personal gain. If you didn't see that coming from the day Donald Trump was elected, you weren't paying attention.\nNo, the real revelation has been the utter depravity of the Republican Party. Essentially every elected or appointed official in that party has chosen to defend Trump by buying into crazy, debunked conspiracy theories. That is, one of America's two major parties is beyond redemption; given that, it's hard to see how democracy can long endure, even if Trump is defeated.\nHowever, the scariest reporting I've seen recently has been about science, not politics. A new federal report finds that climate change in the Arctic is accelerating, matching what used to be considered worst-case scenarios. And there are indications that Arctic warming may be turning into a self-reinforcing spiral, as the thawing tundra itself releases vast quantities of greenhouse gases.\nCatastrophic sea-level rise, heat waves that make major population centers uninhabitable, and more are now looking more likely than not, and sooner rather than later.\nBut the terrifying political news and the terrifying climate news are closely related.\nWhy, after all, has the world failed to take action on climate, and why is it still failing to act even as the danger gets ever more obvious? There are, of course, many culprits; action was never going to be easy.\nBut one factor stands out above all others: the fanatical opposition of America's Republicans, who are the world's only major climate-denialist party. Because of this opposition, the United States hasn't just failed to provide the kind of leadership that would have been essential to global action, it has become a force against action.\nAnd Republican climate denial is rooted in the same kind of depravity that we're seeing with regard to Trump.\nAs I've written in the past, climate denial was in many ways the crucible for Trumpism. Long before the cries of \"fake news,\" Republicans were refusing to accept science that contradicted their prejudices. Long before Republicans began attributing every negative development to the machinations of the \"deep state,\" they were insisting that global warming was a gigantic hoax perpetrated by a vast global cabal of corrupt scientists.\nAnd long before Trump began weaponizing the power of the presidency for political gain, Republicans were using their political power to harass climate scientists and, where possible, criminalize the practice of science itself.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, some of those responsible for these abuses are now ensconced in the Trump administration. Notably, Ken Cuccinelli, who as attorney general of Virginia engaged in a long witch-hunt against the climate scientist Michael Mann, is now at the Department of Homeland Security, where he pushes anti-immigrant policies with, as The Times reports, \"little concern for legal restraints.\"\nBut why have Republicans become the party of climate doom? Money is an important part of the answer: In the current cycle Republicans have received 97 percent of political contributions from the coal industry, 88 percent from oil and gas. And this doesn't even count the wing nut welfare offered by institutions supported by the Koch brothers and other fossil-fuel moguls.\nHowever, I don't believe that it's just about the money. My sense is that right-wingers believe, probably correctly, that there's a sort of halo effect surrounding any form of public action. Once you accept that we need policies to protect the environment, you're more likely to accept the idea that we should have policies to ensure access to health care, child care, and more. So the government must be prevented from doing anything good, lest it legitimize a broader progressive agenda.\nStill, whatever the short-term political incentives, it takes a special kind of depravity to respond to those incentives by denying facts, embracing insane conspiracy theories and putting the very future of civilization at risk.\nUnfortunately, that kind of depravity isn't just present in the modern Republican Party, it has effectively taken over the whole institution. There used to be at least some Republicans with principles; as recently as 2008 Senator John McCain co-sponsored serious climate-change legislation. But those people have either experienced total moral collapse (hello, Senator Graham) or left the party.\nThe truth is that even now I don't fully understand how things got this bad. But the reality is clear: Modern Republicans are irredeemable, devoid of principle or shame. And there is, as I said, no reason to believe that this will change even if Trump is defeated next year.\nThe only way that either American democracy or a livable planet can survive is if the Republican Party as it now exists is effectively dismantled and replaced with something better \u2014 maybe with a party that has the same name, but completely different values. This may sound like an impossible dream. But it's the only hope we have."}, {"idx": 83, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/09/opinion/donald-trump-jews.html", "text": "On Saturday Donald Trump gave a speech to the Israeli American Council in which he asserted that many in his audience were \"not nice people at all,\" but that \"you have to vote for me\" because Democrats would raise their taxes.\nWas he peddling an anti-Semitic stereotype, portraying Jews as money-grubbing types who care only about their wealth? Of course he was. You might possibly make excuses for his remarks if they were an isolated instance, but in fact Trump has done this sort of thing many times, for example asserting in 2015 that Jews weren't supporting him because he wasn't accepting their money and \"you want to control your politicians.\"\nWell, it's not news that Trump's bigotry isn't restricted to blacks and immigrants. What is interesting, however, is that this particular anti-Semitic clich\u00e9 \u2014 that Jews are greedy, and that their political behavior is especially driven by their financial interests \u2014 is empirically dead wrong. In fact, American Jews are much more liberal than you might expect given their economic situation.\nThis is, by the way, a distinction they share with some other groups, especially Asian-Americans. More on that in a minute.\nFirst, some background. The two major political parties in the U.S. really are very different in their policies toward the rich. President Barack Obama was hardly a radical, but when he left office the average federal tax rate on the top 1 percent was 5 percentage points higher than it had been under George W. Bush. In 2016 Trump claimed that he wouldn't do the usual Republican thing and cut taxes on the rich while trying to destroy the safety net. But he was lying.\nAnd despite what right-wing pundits like to claim, high-income Americans are in general much more likely than others to support the Republican Party. In last year's midterms, 52 percent of voters with incomes over $200,000 voted Republican, compared with only 38 percent of voters with incomes under $50,000. The rightward tilt is especially strong at the very top; although there are a few high-profile liberal billionaires, most of the extremely wealthy are also extremely right-wing.\nGiven these realities, you might expect American Jews, who are in fact considerably more affluent than the average, to lean right. But they don't. In fact, only 17 percent of them voted Republican last year.\nIn other words, American Jews aren't the uniquely greedy, self-interested characters anti-Semites imagine them to be. But it would be foolish to make the opposite mistake and imagine that Jews are especially public-spirited; they're just people, with the same virtues and vices as everyone else. I think it was an Israeli friend who first told me that Judaism, unlike other faiths, has rarely been a religion of oppression \u2014 but that the reason was simply lack of opportunity, a diagnosis that recent Israeli governments seem determined to confirm.\nAn aside: American Jews almost all support Israel, but many don't support the policies of its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. But that's presumably a distinction Trump doesn't understand, at home or abroad.\nBack to the question of what makes U.S. Jews politically different. Much of the answer is historical memory. Most of us, I think, know that whenever bigotry runs free, we're likely to be among its victims.\nThe Trump administration is, beyond any reasonable doubt, an anti-democratic, white nationalist regime. And while it is not (yet) explicitly anti-Semitic, many of its allies are: \"Jews will not replace us\" chanted the \"very fine people\" carrying torches in Charlottesville, Va. You have to be willfully ignorant of the past not to know where all this leads. Indeed, it's happening already: anti-Semitic incidents have soared (and my hate mail has gotten \u2026 interesting).\nJews aren't the only people who have figured this out. Many Asian-American voters used to support Republicans, but the group is now overwhelmingly Democratic. Indian-Americans, in particular, are like American Jews: a high-income, high-education group that votes Democratic by large margins, presumably because many of its members also realize where white nationalism will take us.\nIn all of this, Republicans \u2014 not just Trump, but his whole party \u2014 are reaping what they sowed. Their strategy for decades has been to win votes from working-class whites, despite an anti-worker agenda, by appealing to racial resentment. Trump has just made that racial appeal cruder and louder. And one has to admit that this strategy has been quite successful.\nBut it takes, well, chutzpah, a truly striking level of contempt for your audience, to foment hatred-laced identity politics, then turn to members of minority groups and say, in effect, \"Ignore the bigotry and look at the taxes you're saving!\"\nAnd some of the audience deserves that contempt. As I said, people are pretty much the same whatever their background. There are wealthy Jews who are sufficiently shortsighted, ignorant or arrogant enough to imagine that they can continue to prosper under a white nationalist government.\nBut most of my ethnic group, I believe, understands that Trump is bad for the Jews, whatever tax bracket we happen to be in."}, {"idx": 84, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/opinion/trump-trade-tariffs.html", "text": "Almost exactly one year has passed since Donald Trump declared, \"I am a Tariff Man.\" Uncharacteristically, he was telling the truth.\nAt this point I've lost count of how many times markets have rallied in the belief that Trump was winding down his trade war, only to face announcements that a much-anticipated deal wasn't happening or that tariffs were being slapped on a new set of products or countries. Over the past week it happened again: Markets bet on an outbreak of trade peace between the U.S. and China, only to get body slammed by Trump's declaration that there might be no deal before the election and by his new tariffs on Brazil and Argentina.\nSo Trump really is a Tariff Man. But why? After all, the results of his trade war have been consistently bad, both economically and politically.\nI'll offer an answer shortly. First, however, let's talk about what the Trump trade war has actually accomplished.\nA peculiar aspect of the Trump economy is that while overall growth has been solid, the areas of weakness have come precisely in those things Trump tried to stimulate.\nRemember, Trump's only major legislative accomplishment was a huge tax cut for corporations that was supposed to lead to a surge in investment. Instead, corporations pocketed the money, and business investment has been falling.\nAt the same time, his trade war was supposed to shrink the trade deficit and revive U.S. manufacturing. But the trade deficit has widened, and manufacturing output is shrinking.\nThe truth is that even economists who opposed Trump's tax cuts and tariffs are surprised by how badly they're working out. The most commonly given explanation for these bad results is that Trumpian tariff policy is creating a lot of uncertainty, which is giving businesses a strong incentive to postpone any plans they might have for building new factories and adding jobs.\nIn that case, however, why doesn't Trump do what the markets keep wrongly expecting him to do, and call it quits? His continuing tariff obsession seems especially strange given growing evidence that it's hurting him politically.\nIt's important to realize that Trumpian protectionism wasn't a response to a groundswell of public opinion. As best as I can tell from the endless series of interviews with white guys in diners \u2014 who are, we all know, the only Americans who matter \u2014 these voters are driven more by animosity toward immigrants and the sense that snooty liberals look down on them than by trade policy.\nAnd public opinion seems to have become far less protectionist even as Trump has raised tariffs, with the percentage of Americans saying that free trade agreements are a good thing as high as it's ever been.\nSo Trump's trade war is losing, not gaining, support. And one recent analysis finds that it was a factor hurting Republicans in the 2018 midterm elections, accounting for a significant number of lost congressional seats.\nNevertheless, Trump persists. Why?\nOne answer is that Trump has long had a fixation on the idea that tariffs are the answer to America's problems, and he's not the kind of man who reconsiders his prejudices in the light of evidence. But there's also something else: U.S. trade law offers Trump more freedom of action \u2014 more ability to do whatever he wants \u2014 than any other policy area.\nThe basic story is that long ago \u2014 in fact, in the aftermath of the disastrous Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930 \u2014 Congress deliberately limited its own role in trade policy. Instead, it gave the president the power to negotiate trade deals with other countries, which would then face up-or-down votes without amendments.\nIt was always clear, however, that this system needed some flexibility to respond to events. So the executive branch was given the power to impose temporary tariffs under certain conditions: import surges, threats to national security, unfair practices by foreign governments. The idea was that nonpartisan experts would determine whether and when these conditions existed, and the president would then decide whether to act.\nThis system worked well for many years. It turned out, however, to be extremely vulnerable to someone like Trump, for whom everything is partisan and expertise is a four-letter word. Trump's tariff justifications have often been self-evidently absurd \u2014 seriously, who imagines that imports of Canadian steel threaten U.S. national security? But there's no obvious way to stop him from imposing tariffs whenever he feels like it.\nAnd there's also no obvious way to stop his officials from granting individual businesses tariff exemptions, supposedly based on economic criteria but in fact as a reward for political support. Tariff policy isn't the only arena in which Trump can practice crony capitalism \u2014 federal contracting is looking increasingly scandalous \u2014 but tariffs are especially ripe for exploitation.\nSo that's why Trump is a Tariff Man: Tariffs let him exercise unconstrained power, rewarding his friends and punishing his enemies. Anyone imagining that he's going to change his ways and start behaving responsibly is living in a fantasy world."}, {"idx": 85, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/02/opinion/life-expectancy-united-states.html", "text": "\"E pluribus unum\" \u2014 out of many, one \u2014 is one of America's traditional mottos. And you might think it would be reflected in reality. We aren't, after all, just united politically. We share a common language; the unrestricted movement of goods, services and people is guaranteed by the Constitution. Shouldn't this lead to convergence in the way we live and think?\nIn fact, however, the past few decades have been marked by growing divergence among regions along several dimensions, all closely correlated. In particular, the political divide is also, increasingly, an economic divide. As The Times's Tom Edsall put it in a recent article, \"red and blue voters live in different economies.\"\nWhat Edsall didn't point out is that red and blue voters don't just live differently, they also die differently.\nAbout the living part: Democratic-leaning areas used to look similar to Republican-leaning areas in terms of productivity, income and education. But they have been rapidly diverging, with blue areas getting more productive, richer and better educated. In the close presidential election of 2000, counties that supported Al Gore over George W. Bush accounted for only a little over half the nation's economic output. In the close election of 2016, counties that supported Hillary Clinton accounted for 64 percent of output, almost twice the share of Trump country.\nThe thing is, the red-blue divide isn't just about money. It's also, increasingly, a matter of life and death.\nBack in the Bush years I used to encounter people who insisted that the United States had the world's longest life expectancy. They hadn't looked at the data, they just assumed that America was No. 1 on everything. Even then it wasn't true: U.S. life expectancy has been below that of other advanced countries for a long time. \nThe death gap has, however, widened considerably in recent years as a result of increased mortality among working-age Americans. This rise in mortality has, in turn, been largely a result of rising \"deaths of despair\": drug overdoses, suicides and alcohol. And the rise in these deaths has led to declining overall life expectancy for the past few years.\nWhat I haven't seen emphasized is the divergence in life expectancy within the United States and its close correlation with political orientation. True, a recent Times article on the phenomenon noted that life expectancy in coastal metropolitan areas is still rising about as fast as life expectancy in other advanced countries. But the regional divide goes deeper than that.\nA 2018 article in The Journal of the American Medical Association looked at changes in health and life expectancy in U.S. states between 1990 and 2016. The divergence among states is striking. And as I said, it's closely correlated with political orientation.\nI looked at states that voted for Donald Trump versus states that voted for Clinton in 2016, and calculated average life expectancy weighted by their 2016 population. In 1990, today's red and blue states had almost the same life expectancy. Since then, however, life expectancy in Clinton states has risen more or less in line with other advanced countries, compared with almost no gain in Trump country. At this point, blue-state residents can expect to live more than four years longer than their red-state counterparts.\nIs this all about deaths of despair in the eastern heartland? No. Consider our four most populous states. In 1990, Texas and Florida had higher life expectancy than New York and almost matched California; today, they're far behind.\nWhat explains the divergence? Public policy certainly plays some role, especially in recent years, as blue states expanded Medicaid and drastically reduced the number of uninsured, while most red states didn't. The growing gap in educational levels has also surely played a role: Better-educated people tend to be healthier than the less educated.\nBeyond that, there has been a striking divergence in behavior and lifestyle that must be affecting mortality. For example, the prevalence of obesity has soared all across America since 1990, but obesity rates are significantly higher in red states.\nOne thing that's clear, however, is that the facts are utterly inconsistent with the conservative diagnosis of what ails America.\nConservative figures like William Barr, the attorney general, look at rising mortality in America and attribute it to the collapse of traditional values \u2014 a collapse they attribute, in turn, to the evil machinations of \"militant secularists.\" The secularist assault on traditional values, Barr claims, lies behind \"soaring suicide rates,\" rising violence and \"a deadly drug epidemic.\"\nBut European nations, which are far more secularist than we are, haven't seen a comparable rise in deaths of despair and an American-style decline in life expectancy. And even within America these evils are concentrated in states that voted for Trump, and have largely bypassed the more secular blue states.\nSo something bad is definitely happening to American society. But the conservative diagnosis of that problem is wrong \u2014 dead wrong."}, {"idx": 86, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/28/opinion/thanksgiving-trump.html", "text": "So the imaginary \"war on Christmas\" wasn't enough. Donald Trump and Fox News are now accusing progressives of waging a war on Thanksgiving, too, based on, well, nothing. But do Trump and his band of bigots even understand what Thanksgiving is about? If they did, they would hate this most American of holidays.\nAfter all, the Pilgrims were refugees fleeing persecution by the English monarchy, which at the time was still an autocratic regime. They were, in other words, exactly the kind of people Trump and company want to keep out.\nFurthermore, the traditional portrait of the first Thanksgiving is as a moment of racial tolerance and multiculturalism: European immigrants sharing a feast with Native Americans. That moment didn't last: Much of New England's native population was wiped out over the next few decades. And such an outcome may well have been inevitable. But we still celebrate the tale of a benign meeting of races and cultures.\nThanksgiving became an official holiday thanks to an 1863 proclamation by Abraham Lincoln. This was only a few months after he signed the Emancipation Proclamation and just a few weeks before he would deliver the Gettysburg Address, in which he declared that America is a nation dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. So Thanksgiving as we now celebrate it also commemorates the struggle to end slavery.\nFinally, Thanksgiving is thoroughly nondenominational. Lincoln's proclamation gave thanks to Almighty God, but was vague about the Almighty's nature. There's nothing about the holiday that reserves it for believers in any particular religion, or in fact any formal religion at all, and it's open to all cultures. The Times recently reported on the growing popularity of Thanksgiving turkey prepared in the style of Chinese roast duck; nothing could be truer to the holiday's spirit.\nThanksgiving is, in short, a truly American holiday. Not only is it unique to our country, it's a celebration of the values that actually make America great: openness to people who look or act differently, religious tolerance, sympathy for the persecuted, belief in human equality.\nTrue, all too often we pay only lip service to these values; there have been many dark chapters in our nation's history. But we've always managed to emerge from the darkness. Sometimes that emergence took generations; the Jim Crow era in the South lasted close to a century, and isn't entirely gone even now. Still, time and again, from the abolitionists to the civil rights movement, from women's suffrage to L.G.B.T.Q. rights, America's ideals have eventually prevailed, and we have returned to the nation's core values.\nWe are now living through another of those dark chapters. Trump and company are, without question, white nationalists whose values are far closer to those of European blood-and-soil authoritarians than they are to the American tradition. And the entire Republican Party appears ready to back Trump no matter how completely he betrays not just American values, but American interests.\nFurthermore, there's no guarantee that we will emerge from this dark chapter as the nation we used to be. It's true that Trump is an unusually unpopular president; but his approval rating, at around 40 percent or a bit more, is if anything higher than the approval Viktor Orban commanded as he dismantled Hungary's democracy. And Trump, like European white nationalists, is doing his best to remove all the guardrails that were supposed to limit abuse of power, while delegitimizing all opposition.\nBut while an alarming number of Americans seem O.K. with this authoritarian program and embrace of intolerance, the rest of the nation seems reassuringly committed to an open society.\nTrump's efforts to spread fear of brown people actually seem to have backfired: Popular belief that immigrants make a positive contribution to America is at its highest point in decades.\nFurthermore, while Trump may have as many supporters as rising autocrats abroad, he faces much more determined resistance. Opposition to Hungary's Fidesz or Poland's Law and Justice party seemed demoralized and disorganized from the start; Trump's opposition has, when all is said and done, been spirited and cohesive. And the reason isn't just personalities; impressive as Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff are, both the Democratic midterm victory and the effectiveness of the impeachment inquiry ultimately reflect the commitment of many ordinary Americans to sustaining our core values.\nThat said, we could still very well lose it all. But then that was also true when Lincoln first made Thanksgiving a national holiday. Even as he celebrated America's strengths, the nation was in the depths of civil war, and despite Gettysburg and Vicksburg, Union victory was far from assured.\nThe point is that Thanksgiving isn't a celebration of national triumph; it's a celebration of the better angels of America's nature. That's why it's a holiday true patriots, who believe in our nation's underlying values, should love \u2014 and one people like Trump and his supporters should hate."}, {"idx": 87, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/25/opinion/trump-apple.html", "text": "The story that has emerged in the impeachment hearings is one of extortion and bribery. Donald Trump withheld crucial aid \u2014 aid Ukraine needed to defend itself against Russian aggression \u2014 and refused to release it unless Ukraine publicly said it was investigating one of his political rivals. Even Republicans understand this; they just think it's O.K.\nAnd remember, the Ukraine scandal made it into the public eye only because a single whistle-blower set an investigation in motion. I know I'm not alone in wondering how many other comparable scandals haven't come to light.\nNor need these scandals involve foreign governments. What I haven't seen pointed out is that Trump is quietly applying a Ukraine-type extortion-and-bribery strategy to U.S. corporations. Many businesses are being threatened with policies that would hurt their bottom lines \u2014 especially, but not only, tariffs on imported goods crucial to their operations. But they are also being offered the possibility of exemptions from these policies.\nAnd the implicit quid pro quo for such exemptions is that corporations support Donald Trump, or at least refrain from criticizing his actions.\nConsider, for example, what happened last week, when Trump toured an Apple manufacturing plant together with Tim Cook, Apple's C.E.O. Trump used the occasion to make a political speech, attacking impeachment proceedings and falsely claiming that Nancy Pelosi has \"closed Congress.\" He also asserted that the plant, which has been operating since 2013, had just opened.\nAnd Cook, far from correcting these falsehoods, expressed support, declaring that America has the \"strongest economy in the world.\"\nCook's incentive to play along was obvious. Apple assembles many of its products in China; it's seeking exemptions from Trump's China tariffs. And there's every reason to believe that the allocation of such exemptions is driven by politics, not the national interest.\nFor example, in 2018 a company owned by Oleg Deripaska \u2014 an oligarch close to Vladimir Putin, who is supposed to be under U.S. sanctions for activities that include interference in foreign elections \u2014 received a waiver from aluminum tariffs. The waiver was withdrawn only after Democrats in Congress noticed it, with the Commerce Department claiming that it had been granted as a result of a \"clerical error.\" Uh-huh.\nBy the way, if you're wondering why the Trump administration has the power to play favorites, it's because U.S. trade law gives the president a lot of discretion in setting tariffs. The purpose of that discretion was to diminish the power of special interests in Congress, based on the assumption that the president would be better at serving the national interest. But then came Trump.\nAnd tariff policy isn't the only area in which the administration seems to be using its power to punish corporations if they don't show proper political fealty.\nRecently the Pentagon granted the huge Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure contract for cloud computing (yes, JEDI) to Microsoft, shocking observers who expected it to go to Amazon. Amazon is challenging the decision, claiming that it was punishment for critical reporting in The Washington Post, now owned by Jeff Bezos \u2014 a claim that is entirely plausible, given Trump's own repeated declarations that he was going to give Bezos \"problems.\"\nTrump officials claim, of course, that the decision process was squeaky-clean, based on expert judgment untainted by any political influence. But seriously, is anything clean in this administration? Are we really supposed to accept on faith that people who are willing to politicize weather forecasts were totally hands-off when it came to awarding a huge, lucrative contract to a company Trump considers an enemy?\nWhen I and others point out the ways in which Trump is using crony capitalism to lock in political advantage, we tend to get two kinds of pushback. First, we're told that we shouldn't feel sympathy for wealthy corporations. Second, we're told that progressive Democrats also criticize some corporations, like Facebook, and have proposed a crackdown on some kinds of corporate behavior. So what's the difference?\nWell, these critiques (willfully, one suspects) miss the point. What progressives are proposing are rules for corporate behavior that would apply equally to all companies, not be imposed selectively on corporations depending on their political orientation.\nAnd the trouble with Trump's selective doling out of punishment isn't the harm it inflicts on corporations, it's the incentives this regime creates for political sycophancy. American voters and American democracy, not Apple and Amazon \u2014 which are, as it happens, notorious examples of tax avoidance \u2014 are the victims we care about.\nPut it this way: By using his political power to punish businesses that don't support him while rewarding those that do, Trump is taking us along the same path already followed by countries like Hungary, which remains a democracy on paper but has become a one-party authoritarian state in practice. And we're already much further down that road than many people realize."}, {"idx": 88, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/opinion/trump-republicans-corruption.html", "text": "Formally, the House of Representatives is holding an inquiry into the question of whether Donald J. Trump should be impeached. In reality, we've known the answer to that question for a long time. In a different era, when both parties believed in the Constitution, Trump's abuse of his position for personal gain would have led to his removal from office long ago.\nNo, what we're actually witnessing is a test of the depths to which the Republican Party will sink. How much corruption, how much collusion with foreign powers and betrayal of the national interest will that party's elected representatives stand for?\nAnd the result of that test seems increasingly clear: There is no bottom. The inquiry hasn't found a smoking gun; it has found what amounts to a smoking battery of artillery. Yet almost no partisan Republicans have turned on Trump and his high-crimes-and-misdemeanors collaborators. Why not?\nThe answer gets to the heart of what's wrong with modern American politics: The G.O.P. is now a thoroughly corrupt party. Trump is a symptom, not the disease, and our democracy will remain under dire threat even if and when he's gone.\nThe usual explanation you hear for G.O.P. acquiescence in Trumpian malfeasance is that elected Republicans fear being defeated in a primary if they show any hint of wavering. And that's certainly an important part of the story.\nRepublicans haven't forgotten what happened in 2014, when David Brat, a Tea Party insurgent, ousted Eric Cantor, at the time the House majority leader. Cantor was a hard-line conservative, but mild-mannered in affect, and perceived as soft on immigration. The lesson was that the G.O.P. base demands red meat, and these days that means supporting Trump no matter what.\nBut electoral fears aren't the only thing keeping Republicans in line.\nOn one side, I don't think most observers realize, even now, the extent to which many Republicans view their domestic opponents not as fellow citizens but as enemies with no legitimate right to govern. \nWilliam Barr, the attorney general, says that progressives are \"militant secularists\" out to \"destroy the traditional moral order.\" If that's how you see the world, you'll support anything \u2014 up to and including soliciting and/or extorting intervention by foreign powers in U.S. elections \u2014 that helps defeat those progressives.\nOn the other side, it's notable that with few exceptions even Republicans who are leaving or have left office still refuse to criticize Trump. There has been a wave of Republicans announcing retirements from the House, and there's little question that some of these politicians are leaving because they're disgusted with serving this administration. Yet almost none have said so explicitly, even though they won't be facing any more primaries. What keeps them in line?\nThe answer is, follow the money.\nWhat, after all, do retired officials do for a living? Many become lobbyists, and in an era of extreme polarization that means lobbying their own party. Being honest about why you quit would be bad for future business.\nBeyond that, the modern U.S. right contains many institutions \u2014 Fox News and other media, right-wing think tanks, and others \u2014 that offer sinecures to former officials. However, this \"wing-nut welfare\" \u2014 which has no counterpart on the left \u2014 is available only to those who continue to toe the line.\nEarlier I mentioned David Brat, who ousted Eric Cantor. As it happens, Brat himself was defeated in last year's Democratic landslide. So what's he doing now? He's dean of the business school at Jerry Falwell Jr.'s Liberty University.\nSo financial incentives keep even retiring Republicans in line. And the exceptions prove the rule.\nAs far as I can tell, Gordon Sondland, who is ambassador to the European Union \u2014 but surely not for long \u2014 was the first political appointee, as opposed to professional civil servant, to attest to the Trump administration's abuse of power in Ukraine. A key point about Sondland, however, is that he's a rich man who doesn't need wing-nut welfare. \nHe'll live comfortably in retirement as long as he doesn't go to jail. So his incentives were very different from those facing most G.O.P. figures.\nSo are all Republicans corruptly subservient to Trump? No, there are some honorable Never Trumpers, including many of the foreign-policy neocons like William Kristol. Some of us will never forgive this group for misleading us into war, but it turns out that they really do have principles, and deserve recognition for their current political courage.\nBut the modern G.O.P. as a whole is overwhelmingly fanatical, corrupt, or both. Anyone imagining that the mountainous evidence of Trump's malfeasance will lead to a moral awakening, or that Republicans will return to democratic political norms once Trump is gone, is living in a fantasy world. Even catastrophic electoral defeat next year probably wouldn't do much to change Republican behavior.\nThe big question is whether America as we know it can long endure when one of its two major parties has effectively rejected the principles on which our nation was built."}, {"idx": 89, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/opinion/medicare-for-all.html", "text": "Recent state elections \u2014 the Democratic landslide in Virginia, followed by Democratic gubernatorial victories in Kentucky and Louisiana \u2014 have been bad news for Donald Trump.\nAmong other things, the election results vindicate polls indicating that Trump is historically unpopular. All of these races were in part referendums on Trump, who put a lot of effort into backing his preferred candidates. And in each case voters gave him a clear thumbs down.\nBeyond offering a verdict on Trump, however, I'd argue that the state elections offered some guidance on an issue that has divided Democrats, namely health care. What the results suggested to me was the virtue of medium-size reform: incremental enough to have a good chance of being enacted, big enough to provide tangible benefits that voters don't want taken away.\nRemember, there was a third governor's race, in Mississippi, in which the G.O.P. held on. True, Mississippi is a very red state, which Trump won by 18 points in 2016. But Louisiana and Kentucky are or were, if anything, even redder, with Trump margins of 20 and 30 points respectively. So what made the difference?\nPersonalities surely mattered. Louisiana's re-elected John Bel Edwards was widely liked, Kentucky's defeated Matt Bevin widely disliked. Demography probably also mattered. Urban and especially suburban voters have turned hard against Trump, but rural voters haven't, at least so far \u2014 and Mississippi is one of the few states left with a majority-rural population.\nBut there's another difference among the three states. Kentucky and Louisiana took advantage of the Affordable Care Act to expand Medicaid, leading to steep drops in the number of uninsured residents; Mississippi hasn't. This meant that voting Democratic in Kentucky and Louisiana meant voting to preserve past policy success, while the same vote in Mississippi was at best about hope for future reform \u2014 a much less powerful motivator.\nBack in 2010, as Obamacare was about to squeak through Congress, Nancy Pelosi famously declared, \"We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.\" This line was willfully misrepresented by Republicans (and some reporters who should have known better) as an admission that there was something underhanded about the way the legislation was enacted. What she meant, however, was that voters wouldn't fully appreciate the A.C.A. until they experienced its benefits in real life.\nIt took years to get there, but in the end Pelosi was proved right, as health care became a winning issue for Democrats. In the 2018 midterms and in subsequent state elections, voters punished politicians whom they suspected of wanting to undermine key achievements like protection for pre-existing conditions and, yes, Medicaid expansion.\nAnd this political reality has arguably set the stage for further action. At this point, as far as I can tell, all of the contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination are calling for a significant expansion of the government's role in health care, although they differ about how far and how fast to go.\nWhich brings me to the latest development in intra-Democratic policy disputes: Elizabeth Warren's proposal for a two-step approach to health reform. Her idea is to start with actions \u2014 some requiring no legislation at all, others requiring only a simple Senate majority \u2014 that would greatly expand health insurance coverage. These actions would, if successful, deliver tangible benefits to millions.\nThey would not, however, amount to the full Bernie, eliminating private insurance and going full single-payer. Warren still says that this is her eventual intention, and has laid out a plan to pay for such a system. But any legislative push would wait three years, giving time for voters to see the benefits of the initial changes.\nSanders supporters are, predictably, crying betrayal. For them it's all or nothing: a commitment to single-payer has to be in the legislation from Day 1. \nThe trouble with such demands, aside from the strong probability that proposing elimination of private insurance would be a liability in the general election, is that such legislation would almost certainly fail to pass even a Democratic Senate. So all or nothing would, in practice, mean nothing.\nBut is Warren giving up on Medicare for All? After all, what she's offering isn't really a transition plan in the usual sense, since there's no guarantee that Step 2 would ever happen.\nThe lesson I take from the politics of Obamacare, however, is that successful health reform, even if incomplete, creates the preconditions for further reform. What looks impossible now might look very different once tens of millions of additional people have actual experience with expanded Medicare, and can compare it with private insurance.\nAlthough I've long argued against making Medicare for All a purity test, there is a good case for eventually going single-payer. But the only way that's going to happen is via something like Warren's approach: initial reforms that deliver concrete benefits, and maybe provide a steppingstone to something even bigger."}, {"idx": 90, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/opinion/trump-republicans-pollution.html", "text": "Given what we've seen in the impeachment hearings so far, there is literally no crime, no abuse of power, that would induce Republicans to turn on President Trump. So if you're waiting for some dramatic political turn, don't hold your breath.\nOn second thought, however, maybe you should hold your breath. For air quality has deteriorated significantly over the past few years \u2014 a deterioration that has already cost thousands of American lives. And if Trump remains in power, the air will get much worse, and the death toll rise dramatically, in the years ahead.\nThe story so far: When I talk about air pollution, I don't mean the greenhouse gases that are driving climate change, which pose a long-term existential threat. I'm talking instead about pollutants that have a much more immediate effect, especially \"fine particulate matter,\" small particles that make the air hazy and can penetrate deep into the respiratory tract. The health hazards of these particles have been documented by many studies.\nThe good news until a few years ago was that thanks to environmental regulation the concentration of fine particulates was in fairly rapid decline. The bad news is that since 2016 this kind of pollution has been on the rise again, reversing around a fifth of the gains since 2009.\nA study documenting this reversal suggests multiple causes, including wildfires (themselves caused in part by climate change), increased driving and reduced enforcement. The study also finds, using well-established results on the health effects of pollution, that even this seemingly small rise in particulates led to almost 10,000 extra deaths last year.\nTo put this number in context, it may be helpful to remember that Trump began his presidency by talking about \"American carnage,\" portraying a nation awash in violent crime. In reality, crime was and is near historic lows. To the extent that anything was behind his rant, it lay in a modest (and temporary) uptick in homicides from around 14,000 in 2014 to 17,000 in 2016.\nThe point is that the Trump-era death toll from worsening air is already several times as large as the \"carnage\" Trump decried.\nIt seems crass to point this out, but the economic cost of rising pollution is also large; the study puts it at $89 billion a year. This is a pretty big number, even in an economy as large as America's, and it means that economic growth under Trump, properly measured, has been significantly slower than standard numbers suggest.\nAnd things are poised to get much worse. The Trump administration is working on new rules that would effectively prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from making use of much of the scientific evidence on adverse health effects of pollution. This would cripple environmental regulation, almost surely leading to sharply worsening air and water quality over time.\nWe don't know exactly how this will play out, but it seems safe to say that if Trump stays in office, a lot more Americans will die as a result of his anti-environmental policies than the total number who are murdered, let alone murdered by the immigrants Trump loves to portray as a menacing, dark-skinned horde.\nWhy is this happening? As many observers have pointed out, failing to act on climate change, although it's an indefensible crime against humanity, is also in some ways understandable. Greenhouse gas emissions are invisible, and the harm they do is global and very long-term, making denialism relatively easy.\nParticulates, however, are visible, and the harm they do is both relatively localized and fairly quick. So you might have thought that the fight against dirty air would have widespread, bipartisan support. Indeed, modern environmental protection began under none other than Richard Nixon, and retired E.P.A. officials I've talked to describe the Nixon era as a golden age.\nAnd Republicans continued to show at least some concern for the environment even after the party began to take a hard right turn. President Ronald Reagan signed a treaty to protect the ozone layer. The threat of acid rain was contained via a program enacted by President George H.W. Bush.\nBut that was a long time ago. Today's Republican Party isn't just a party that has embraced crazy conspiracy theories about global warming (and everything else where the facts are inconvenient.) It has also become the party of pollution.\nWhy? Follow the money. There's huge variation among industries in how much environmental damage they do per dollar of production. And the super-polluting industries have basically put all their chips on the Republicans. In 2016, for example, coal mining gave 97 percent of its political contributions to Republican candidates and causes. And polluters are getting what they paid for.\nThis, by the way, is one reason I and others find it so mind-boggling when people like Joe Biden say that everything will be fine once Trump is gone. If Trump doesn't succeed in destroying our democracy (a big if), his most damaging legacy will be the vast environmental destruction he leaves behind. And Trump's pro-pollution stance isn't an aberration. In this, he is very much a man of his party."}], "Caroline Fredrickson": [{"idx": 91, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/opinion/trump-bill-barr-.html", "text": "President Trump famously asked, \"Where's my Roy Cohn?\" Demanding a stand-in for his old personal lawyer and fixer, Mr. Trump has actually gotten something better with Bill Barr: a lawyer who like Cohn stops seemingly at nothing in his service to Mr. Trump and conveniently sits atop the nation's Justice Department. \nMr. Barr has acted more like a henchman than the leader of an agency charged with exercising independent judgment. The disturbing message that sends does not end at our borders \u2014\u00a0it extends to countries, like those in the former East Bloc, struggling to overcome an illiberal turn in the direction of autocracy. \nWhen Mr. Trump sought to have President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine announce an investigation of his political opponent, he likely expected a positive response. After all, politicized prosecutions had been part of Ukraine's corrupt political culture for years. \nOn Monday, when Michael Horowitz, inspector general for the Justice Department, released a report that affirmed the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election was justified, Mr. Barr immediately turned on his own agency in defense of the president. \n\"The F.B.I. launched an intrusive investigation of a U.S. presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken,\" he said.\nSimilarly, Mr. Barr's response to the report from Robert Mueller on Russian interference and Mr. Trump's purported presidential misconduct was to cast doubt on his own staff, questioning their work product as well as their ethics and legal reasoning. Even before he became attorney general, Mr. Barr questioned Mr. Mueller's investigation of the president for obstruction of justice in a 19-page legal memo he volunteered to the administration.\nAnd where he could have neutrally passed Mr. Mueller's findings to Congress, he instead took the widely criticized and unusual step of making and announcing his own legal conclusions about Mr. Mueller's obstruction inquiry. He followed up this Cohn-like behavior with testimony in the Senate, where he insinuated that the United States government spied on the Trump campaign. Mr. Barr apparently has decided that, like Cohn, he serves Donald Trump and not the Constitution or the United States, flouting his oath of office and corrupting the mission of the Justice Department.\nIn the past, the United States has, however imperfectly, advanced the rule of law and supported governments committed to an anti-corruption agenda. According to George Kent, a State Department official who testified in the House impeachment inquiry, Russia sees corruption as a tool to advance its interests. So when the United States fights a kleptocratic culture, it serves not only lofty humanitarian goals but also our national security. Mr. Zelensky ran a campaign and was elected on a platform that put fighting corruption at the forefront. He should have received extensive and unmitigated support in that effort.\nIn the former East Bloc countries, despite the hopes of many for a post-Soviet era where democracy would thrive, the parties and politicians in power have consolidated their control in a manner reminiscent of the Communist era.\nAutocrats understand that supposedly independent institutions such as the courts and prosecutors are vital to locking in their power. In Romania, a crusading anti-corruption prosecutor who was investigating top government officials was fired at the same time as the government advanced legislation to cabin the ability of other prosecutors to pursue cases against political officials. Poland's right-wing populist Law and Justice Party has attacked the independent judiciary and has sought to remove judges who do not follow the party line. Hungary has followed suit. Bulgarian politicians have persecuted civil society groups that have criticized their abandonment of the rule of law.\nWhile several United States ambassadors have attempted to support anti-corruption efforts in the region, they have been continuously undercut by the White House. In addition to firing Marie Yovanovitch, who served as ambassador to Ukraine, in part because of her anti-corruption focus, Mr. Trump hosted Viktor Orban of Hungary in Washington over the objections of national security officials who did not want to elevate a corrupt leader with close ties to the Kremlin; furthermore, the president has tried to cut funding for anti-corruption programs.\nMr. Trump's focus on cultivating foreign leaders who can help his re-election has overwhelmed our national interests in the region. That is certainly a shame for the anti-corruption activists in former Communist countries who have depended on our help and leadership since the end of the Soviet era and who have seen their justice system turned to serve political ends. \nBut for Americans, we must worry that we face a similar domestic situation: a prosecutor who bends to the political needs of the president. Mr. Trump may no longer be able to call on Roy Cohn, but he now has a stronger ally in the United States' top law-enforcement official, who thinks that if the president does it, it can't be wrong.

I was in the Office of Legislative Affairs \u2014 but all legislative work had ground to a halt with President Bill Clinton facing impeachment in the House. Instead, we compiled a daily catalog of statements by members of Congress about Mr. Clinton's actions and their possible consequences.\nWhile it wasn't a great way to start a career, that experience offered an accidental insight into the current impeachment process \u2014 and a warning about overreach by the Democrats.\nBack in 1998, House Republicans put together a fairly straightforward case against the president: Mr. Clinton was accused of having an affair with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, and then lying about it. The Republicans took full advantage of this simple story to advance their claim that a president of questionable morals should not remain in office. The statements we tracked divided into easy categories; some members thought the affair was enough to sink the president, while others thought the lying was the impeachable offense.\nPresident Trump's White House no doubt has a similar operation. But while our job was simple because the narrative of Mr. Clinton's sins was easy to grasp, today's allegations are all over the map and could amount to a lengthy list of articles of impeachment. \nUnfortunately for House Democrats, the complexity of this story does not help their cause. Mr. Trump has destroyed so many norms, has been credibly accused of breaking so many laws and has otherwise engaged in such a dizzying array of possibly impeachable behaviors that any intelligible story line has been blurred, if not obliterated. The enormity of his alleged transgressions works, perversely, to his advantage.\nRight now Democrats are debating whether to focus articles of impeachment solely on the Ukraine scandal, or to add multiple other charges, ranging from obstruction of justice and other illegal or unethical actions detailed in the Mueller report, to personal enrichment in violation of the Constitution's emoluments clause. The latter, however satisfying, would be a mistake.\nEven though it means leaving out actions many members believe independently merit removing this president from office, which would frustrate many, there may be virtue in keeping the focus narrow at least in how they talk about the case against Mr. Trump.\nThe impeachment case of Richard Nixon offers a fruitful example. There are many obvious parallels between Mr. Trump and Nixon, including their venal behavior, demonization of the news media and the fact that both investigations have included evidence of break-ins into the Democratic National Committee headquarters. Both presidents also sought to persuade a foreign power to interfere in our elections \u2014 Mr. Trump with Ukraine and Nixon with South Vietnam. \nThe list goes on, and yet the impeachment case against Nixon was founded on a simple, straightforward story: his role in the cover-up of the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington. \nWhat made the public sit up and take notice was the release, on Aug. 5, 1974, of a transcript of the so-called Smoking Gun Tape, which made it impossible for Nixon to argue that he was unaware of and uninvolved in the cover-up. The president's support in Congress crumbled. Representative John Jacob Rhodes, a Republican Nixon loyalist who served as the minority leader in the House, stated it most directly: \"Cover-up of criminal activity and misuse of federal agencies can neither be condoned nor tolerated.\"\nDonald Trump is the master of diversionary tactics. Every day through tweets and press statements, he spreads falsehoods, attacks his opponents on made-up grounds and sometimes even gives congressional committees new avenues of illegality to follow for impeachment or prosecution. Each of these new story lines must be ignored. The best story line is the simple one: Mr. Trump tried to bribe a foreign official with American government dollars to announce an investigation of unfounded charges against a domestic political rival. There is more, much more. But that's enough."}, {"idx": 93, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/opinion/trump-impeachment-hearing.html", "text": "With the impeachment inquiry underway in the House of Representatives, House members have the choice of maintaining a deliberate and thoughtful process or succumbing to the temptations of reality TV and social media memes, turning a solemn and serious undertaking into a political circus. Unfortunately, if Wednesday's opening round was any indication, Republicans have decided to pursue the latter \u2014 with gusto.\nThe risk that an impeachment inquiry into President Trump would invite crass politicization was always going to be high: Look at the players. In a starring role, we have the P.T. Barnum of presidents, a man who somehow escaped his legacy of bankruptcies to become an all-powerful executive on television. His role was to yell \"you're fired\" to eliminate contestants on \"The Apprentice.\" He obviously did a good job memorizing his lines, and has used that phrase regularly in the White House. That same dark, manic energy has infected his most outspoken defenders, including two, Representatives Devin Nunes and Jim Jordan, who participated in Wednesday's hearing.\nAnother major figure in this drama, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, can claim to be the only other national leader whose election was even more dependent on artifice. Mr. Zelensky created and starred in a television series called\u202f\"Servant of the People\" in which he played a teacher elected president of Ukraine on an anti-corruption platform. Mr. Zelensky's message of fighting a culture of government graft hit a nerve with the Ukrainian people, who subsequently elected the actor president, representing a party named after the TV show.\nNow these two TV personalities are joined in one program that is being aired in front of the American people. The charge that Mr. Trump attempted to leverage foreign aid to Ukraine to advance his 2020 electoral prospects provides an ironic counterpoint to Mr. Zelensky's election as a reformer and specifically a fighter against the bribery prevalent in Ukraine under his predecessor, Petro Poroshenko.\nThen there are Mr. Trump's supporting characters, beginning with his lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his two Ukrainian American sidekicks, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman \u2014 a casting agent's dream. Even the arrest of those two henchmen, recently charged with criminal violations of campaign finance laws, was dramatic, verging on staged, as federal law enforcement agents apprehended them on the jetway as they tried to board a plane to flee the country.\nNone of the details, despite how delicious they might seem to media commentators, should persuade anyone to ignore the main focus of this undertaking: The House of Representatives is considering whether to draft articles of impeachment against a sitting president. Impeachment is rightly a very rare occurrence. A democracy must respect the election process, unless an official has committed a \"high crime or misdemeanor\" that may have or has inflicted fundamental harm to our nation.\nStill, during the weeks leading up to Wednesday, it was always clear that the two parties largely occupied two realities, with Democrats intent on whether President Trump violated his oath of office, and Republicans intent on serving up sound bites for a Fox News highlight reel.\nTo his credit, Congressman Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has constructed an approach that could avoid sullying this solemn hearing with partisan antics. In consultation with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and other congressional leaders, he has put at least some of the questioning of witnesses in the hands of capable professional staff. The Democrats' approach is one that was used during Watergate and recognizes that exposing the facts is the most important part of any hearing and helps ensure that the hearings don't become political theater.\nMany members of Congress \u2014 in both parties \u2014 likely find this process frustrating. Most of them, accustomed to the freewheeling hearings usually held by committees, are used to mining such moments for campaign fodder; scoring political points or getting out a glib phrase are the main goal. The urge to utter a hash-taggable phrase generally trumps efforts to build a coherent narrative in service of an objective, like uncovering government malfeasance or incompetence.\nAs the hearings progress, Mr. Schiff and Ms. Pelosi must resist pressure to provide opportunities for their fellow members, Democrats or Republicans, to grandstand by opening up questioning to all those who are no doubt demanding the floor. Outside of Congress, political organizations, including the two national committees, have set up \"war rooms\" to battle each other in a Twitter war over the hearings. These efforts are unseemly and only serve to underscore the danger of our politics becoming just another version of reality TV.\nSo how did the committee do on its first day? It could have been worse; Mr. Schiff used the House rules deftly to rebut the most egregious of Republican attempts to distract the hearing by bringing up conspiracy theories based on spurious evidence. But this was not for lack of trying: Representative Jordan manically repeated conspiracy-tinged Republican talking points, sticking to the script outlined by the president himself, tweet by tweet.\nRepeating the false claim that Mr. Schiff and the Democrats know the identity of the whistle-blower, who first alerted the world to Mr. Trump's Ukraine machinations, and are keeping it a secret from Republicans, Mr. Jordan demanded that the public get to hear from the \"person who started it all.\" Without irony or shame, Mr. Jordan shouted that the whistle-blower was the person most eagerly trying to undermine the rule of law, and not the president who decided to use foreign aid as leverage to instigate the investigation of a political rival.\nAs president, Mr. Trump has fought congressional efforts at oversight with a vehemence that far exceeds the resistance of past presidents. Attempting to change the narrative about Russian interference in the 2016 election, he attacked his enemies and reviled any intelligence officials who provided evidence that the interference had indeed happened. He has fired multiple high-level aides and excoriated others. From the beginning of his presidency, Mr. Trump has tried to gaslight us into believing we are living in his TV show.\nWith the opening of the impeachment inquiry, Congress has the opportunity to remind the public what's at stake. This is not an episode of \"The Apprentice\" or \"Judge Judy.\" We are witnessing a vital moment in American history. Let's hope these hearings serve as a lesson in responsible governance and not as an epitaph for reality-based politics."}, {"idx": 94, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/20/opinion/impeachment-house-vote.html", "text": "President Trump and Republicans have insisted that House Democrats take a vote to open a formal impeachment inquiry before engaging in thoroughgoing oversight of the administration's activities related to Ukraine. This is a political calculation \u2014 relying on faulty analysis of the Clinton impeachment \u2014 that a formal inquiry will backfire on Democrats.\nThe Constitution makes no such requirement for conducting an impeachment investigation. Furthermore, it assigns to Congress the important duty of oversight. \nSo Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other House Democrats have decided, as is their constitutional prerogative, against a vote on the impeachment inquiry. A decision to pursue the specific pathway of impeachment is not a precondition for conducting congressional fact-finding. And in fact, previous impeachment investigations were preceded by months of congressional oversight. \nThe Supreme Court has long held that Congress's oversight authorities are inherent in its Article I legislative powers. These oversight authorities are \"broad\" and encompass matters including \"the administration of existing laws,\" \"proposed or possibly needed statutes\" and inquiries \"to expose corruption, inefficiency and waste.\" Indeed, the court has emphasized that oversight is \"essential\" to the conduct of government.\nCongressional investigations often lead to the development of new laws, but Congress may also address oversight findings through other actions. Some investigations have led Congress to conclude that enacting new laws is not the answer to issues identified in an inquiry. Some congressional oversight proceedings have led to executive branch reforms. Some inquiries into alleged administration corruption have resulted in resignations, referrals, House or Senate resolutions memorializing disapproval of presidential or other administration misconduct \u2014 or on occasion the start of impeachment proceedings.\nIndeed, congressional history is replete with investigations of alleged White House misconduct that have not involved impeachment. Many of these \u2014 during both Republican and Democratic administrations \u2014 involved congressional deposition or hearing testimony from top White House aides.\nFor example, the Senate Judiciary Committee investigated business dealings of President Jimmy Carter's brother and alleged related White House communications, taking testimony from the national security adviser and the president's press secretary. A joint House and Senate committee reviewed the role of the Reagan White House in the diversion of Iran arms sales funds to Nicaraguan contras and took testimony from, among others, two national security advisers to the president and the national security adviser to the vice president. Committees in both the House and Senate conducted inquiries into whether the Clinton White House engaged in campaign finance improprieties and took testimony from numerous White House officials (including a chief of staff, a deputy chief of staff, two counsels, two deputy counsels, the chief of staff to the first lady and the national security adviser). Further, the House Oversight Committee investigated inappropriate use of nongovernment email for official business by the George W. Bush White House, taking deposition testimony from two White House political directors.\nIn the Watergate investigation, the House approval of an impeachment resolution actually followed months of direct, rigorous congressional oversight. In February 1973, the Senate established a select committee to investigate allegations of wrongdoing potentially involving the Nixon White House. It wasn't until February 1974 that the House commenced impeachment proceedings (the Senate select committee continued its inquiry through June 1974).\nWith Bill Clinton, the independent counsel inquiry that resulted in an impeachment referral to the House of Representatives in September 1998 originated in 1994 as an inquiry into alleged improprieties relating to investments by Mr. Clinton and Hillary Clinton in a real estate company in Arkansas, the Whitewater Development Corporation. Long before the October 1998 House resolution initiating impeachment proceedings, Congress conducted extensive investigations into Whitewater.\nContrary to the Trump administration's resistance to House committees' requests for testimony and documents from current and former White House and executive branch staff members, the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the Whitewater Land Development Corporation and Related Matters took testimony from two Clinton White House counsels, Bernard Nussbaum and Lloyd Cutler. There were numerous other senior White House aides who provided testimony for congressional Whitewater inquiries.\nThe evidence being amassed regarding Ukraine alone is damning and raises serious concerns about the conduct of national security, financial self-dealing and straight-out corruption. The jaw-dropping revelations may indeed push the House to adopt articles of impeachment. \nBut there is no constitutional requirement and no historical practice that requires it to do so to engage in its true constitutional duty of oversight of an executive run amok. "}, {"idx": 95, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/opinion/robert-mueller-hearings.html", "text": "On Wednesday, in sworn congressional testimony, Special Counsel Robert Mueller publicly confirmed 100 percent of the devastating findings of his report, and made clear that his inquiry does not exonerate the president. Within 24 hours, though, the conversation has coalesced around a few superficial observations: Mr. Mueller underperformed and the Republicans overplayed their hand, but in the end, this is just about the end of the road for investigations around President Trump, let alone talk of impeachment.\nNot so fast. Cooler heads in Congress and the news media are pressing forward on the material presented by Mr. Mueller's team, especially the possibility that the president attempted to obstruct justice. But there's something else to keep in mind: There's a lot more to the case against Mr. Trump and his associates than what came up in Wednesday's hearings.\nFirst, while Mr. Mueller's inquiry generated 37 criminal indictments and has secured at least seven guilty pleas or convictions, some of these cases, including the prosecution of the longtime Trump associate Roger Stone, are ongoing, and were not fully addressed in the redacted Mueller report. \nSecond, the extent of Mr. Trump's past or continuing business dealings with Russia remains a mystery. Mr. Mueller confirmed that it was outside the scope of his investigation to address whether Russians laundered money through Trump businesses, and declined to discuss whether he reviewed Mr. Trump's tax returns. \nAnd third, the special counsel has referred numerous cases to other law enforcement authorities \u2014 including at least one involving alleged misconduct by the president regarding campaign contributions. \nThe Roger Stone chapter may seem like a sideshow, but it raises the question of how much advance knowledge the Trump campaign had of WikiLeaks' release of Democratic emails hacked by Russians, and how Trump associates used that information in their campaign strategy. \nElements of this saga are part of the public record. Mr. Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen stated in sworn congressional testimony that in July 2016, he heard Mr. Stone inform Mr. Trump that he had spoken with Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, and that Mr. Assange planned to release emails that would \"damage Hillary Clinton's campaign.\" And according to the Mueller report, Rick Gates, the deputy Trump campaign head, said that by the late summer of 2016 the campaign was planning \"a press strategy, a communications campaign, and messaging based on the possible release of Clinton emails by WikiLeaks.\" Mr. Mueller confirmed in testimony yesterday that the campaign devised its strategy around documents stolen by Russia and covered this up.\nHowever, the public is still in the dark about much involving the WikiLeaks releases, and specifically how much Mr. Trump knew about or participated in the arrangement. For example, the Mueller report heavily redacts the text surrounding its references to conversations Mr. Trump had with Mr. Cohen, Mr. Gates and his campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, after the July 2016 WikiLeaks release \u2014 including the discussion Mr. Gates reported, in which he said Mr. Trump told him \"more releases of damaging information would be coming.\" \nCongress needs to examine whether the extremely convenient coincidence of the leak of more emails on Oct. 7, 2016, just one hour after an \"Access Hollywood\" tape revealed Mr. Trump bragging about assaulting women, was in fact just that, a coincidence, or was instead another act of coordination by the Trump campaign or the candidate's associates.\nMr. Mueller's testimony and report also do not resolve questions about the extent of Trump financial dealings with Russia. Congress needs to examine closely whether the president or his associates are compromised in any way by those relationships.\nThen there is the matter of additional referrals. According to the special counsel's report, Mr. Mueller referred no less than 14 separate matters to other law enforcement authorities on the grounds that they were outside his jurisdiction. While the report entirely redacts its discussion of 12 of these cases, it makes clear that at least one involved the president's conduct: the case handled by the Southern District of New York that led to the conviction of Mr. Cohen for campaign-finance violations involving payments he said he made on Mr. Trump's behalf. It is critical to understand the full scope of Mr. Trump's participation to ensure accountability and evaluate whether current laws on campaign finance address and deter misconduct.\nFinally, Congress should examine why the president refused to sit for an interview with Mr. Mueller, and whether that is indicative of any additional wrongdoing by him or his associates. The president instead gave written responses in which, on more than 30 occasions, he said he \"'does not recall' or 'remember' or 'have an independent recollection,'\" Mr. Mueller said. When asked on Wednesday whether he thought the president's written answers to Mr. Mueller's questions \"showed that he wasn't always being truthful,\" Mr. Mueller agreed. \nWhatever the press and pundits are saying in the aftermath of Mr. Mueller's testimony, Wednesday's hearings were not the end of the road; they were not even the beginning of it. Examination of the questions concerning President Trump's actions and other misconduct identified by Mr. Mueller should be the highest priority for every member of Congress, no matter their party affiliation. Public accountability requires nothing less, because no one in this country, no matter how high, should be above the law."}, {"idx": 96, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/opinion/mueller-report-redactions.html", "text": "Congress is on a two-week recess. Americans are on spring break, with worshipers gathering for Good Friday, Passover and Easter across the country. For an attorney general who has operated more as a flack and a flunky than an independent official concerned with justice, Thursday is the perfect day to dump a report, script a response and be sure that most Americans aren't paying attention. And an unexpected distraction, the burning of Notre-Dame Cathedral, means most of the world won't be focused on Washington either.\nAttorney General William Barr is counting on us to be satisfied that the report is not as heavily redacted as feared. And while a few members of Congress will get a less redacted version \u2014 absent grand jury material \u2014 the American public and the Congress have a right to know about Russian interference in our election, Russian contacts with the presidential campaign of Donald Trump and evidence of obstruction of justice by the president. In that light, even these redactions are too many.\nThe \"18-and-a-half-minute gap\" \u2014 a stretch of audiotape from the White House that had been suspiciously erased \u2014 is a shameful reminder of how certain insiders serving in the Nixon administration worked to cover up the president's crimes. While some Nixon aides are now venerated for refusing to carry out corrupt instructions during the Watergate inquiries, others bear the stain of helping the president hide misconduct.\nWhen history judges Attorney General William Barr, the verdict on his decision to withhold large portions of the final report by the special counsel Robert Mueller from Congress is likely to be severe. Of course, we don't know what lies underneath these redactions, but we have reason to worry: Mr. Barr has shown little appetite for asserting independence from President Trump. \nMr. Barr's recent conduct brings to mind Mr. Nixon's executive assistant and personal secretary, Rose Mary Woods, and her role in the Watergate inquiry.\nReportedly an upstanding and dedicated aide to the president, Ms. Woods emerged in the public eye after Congress and the special prosecutor demanded White House recordings of presidential conversations relevant to the June 1972 burglary at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex. When the White House had to reveal to the court that the tapes contained an 18-and-a-half-minute gap, the White House counsel said that Ms. Woods would provide an explanation.\nWhile technical analysts raised questions about whether Ms. Woods could have caused the gap, she detailed her account for the record, reportedly \"combative at times\" with the prosecutors, and remained on Mr. Nixon's staff through his resignation. In the grand scheme of things, out of Mr. Nixon's over 3,000 hours of recorded conversations, 18 and a half minutes doesn't seem like a lot \u2014 but let's remember that the smoking-gun tape itself was only eight minutes long. We need to know what he's covering up.\nOn the stand, Ms. Woods tried to take the fall for at least part of that gap. She claimed she had accidentally hit \"record\" instead of \"stop\" while reaching for the phone during a tape transcription session. Her re-enactment of this event, memorialized in a photo the White House released, became known as the \"Rose Mary stretch.\" While technical analysts raised questions about whether Ms. Woods could have caused the gap, she stuck to her account.\nWhen it comes to the Mueller inquiry into presidential misconduct, Mr. Barr has acted more like a loyal presidential aide than the leader of an agency charged with exercising independent judgment. He questioned Mr. Mueller's investigation of the president for obstruction of justice early on in a 19-page legal memo he volunteered to the administration, even before taking the helm at the Department of Justice.\nAnd where he could have neutrally passed Mr. Mueller's findings to Congress, he instead took the widely criticized and unusual step of making and announcing his own legal conclusions about Mr. Mueller's obstruction inquiry. Then, instead of working with Congress and the courts to facilitate disclosure of the Mueller report to Congress, he set forth a redaction process that appears designed to deny Congress information to which it is legally entitled and that defies precedent.\nIn short, Mr. Barr has a record of appearing to seek opportunities to sow disregard for the Mueller inquiry and reduce transparency with Congress and the public about its findings. His recent Senate testimony making unsupported insinuations that the United States government spied on the Trump campaign provided further evidence of this troubling reflex.\nA revealing report by Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University, about Mr. Barr's past conduct with Congress is cause for additional concern. According to Mr. Goodman, Mr. Barr misled Congress about the contents of a document withheld from Congress in 1989, during his prior service as the head of the Office of Legal Counsel. When asked at the time to produce an O.L.C. opinion on the F.B.I. taking people into custody in foreign nations without the countries' consent, he instead provided a summary that omitted key conclusions \u2014 conclusions that proved highly controversial when they were disclosed years later. \nCongress needs to review the unredacted Mueller report and its underlying evidence so that history does not repeat itself. Full disclosure is integral for Congress to protect national security and the rule of law, and to ensure that redactions do not reflect a \"Bill Barr stretch\" to protect the president."}, {"idx": 97, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/opinion/trump-mueller-report.html", "text": "People lie to hide the truth. They lie to hide crimes. And while everyone is dying for a peek at Robert Mueller's bombshell report to see if he says any crimes were committed by the Trump campaign in 2016, the truth is actually already out there, hidden in plain sight.\nMr. Mueller's report may never go public, but we don't need a peek at the recommendations he delivered on Friday to Attorney General William Barr to credibly assess that something unethical and likely illegal went on in 2016. The repeated lies told by Trump campaign staff members \u2014 lies about their connections to Russian figures \u2014 already spin a grand tale of conspiracy and deceit. And it's a tale so suspect and sordid that President Trump and his associates felt the need to lie to hide it from law enforcement.\nThis is not conjecture; some of Mr. Trump's people are already in jail, having been convicted in federal court for lying to investigators about their connections to and interactions with Russians during the 2016 campaign. Others have pleaded guilty to similar crimes, which \u2014 it bears repeating \u2014 is what one does when presented with overwhelming evidence of one's guilt. Still others await trial. Many more have been indicted.\nThere's the top Trump campaign official Paul Manafort, who is serving time for lying about his history of lobbying for Russian interests and sharing Trump campaign polling data with a Russian intelligence asset during the campaign.\nAnd there's the close Trump associate Roger Stone, recently indicted on charges of lying about communications he had with Wikileaks before it released damaging information about Hillary Clinton that law enforcement believes was stolen by Russian hackers.\nThe former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen is headed to jail after admitting that he lied to Congress about a business deal Mr. Trump was pursuing with Russian figures throughout the 2016 campaign, lies Mr. Trump himself echoed on the campaign trail.\nMichael Flynn, the president's former national security adviser, will soon be doing time after admitting to making false statements to the F.B.I. to conceal December 2016 communications with Russia regarding the sanctions on Russia imposed by the Obama administration.\nLastly, there is George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the campaign, who arguably helped precipitate the investigation when he bragged about his knowledge of Russian \"dirt\" on Mrs. Clinton to an Australian diplomat who then alerted the F.B.I. Mr. Papadopoulos subsequently pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and served time in prison.\nThen there is the president himself.\nFrom the outset, Mr. Trump's approach to the Mueller investigation has been characterized by paranoia and fear. With his increasingly shrill denials, the president comes across more as someone who fears he will be found out than someone convinced of his innocence.\nAnd he has lied to the American people.\nThe president's version of events regarding his campaign's interactions with Russia has changed repeatedly since the investigation began. From early assertions during his campaign that he had no business interests in Russia, to claims about his role in issuing false statements about the infamous Trump Tower meeting with Russians, the president has been caught in numerous, verifiable lies on this issue. It just remains to be seen whether he lied to cover up actual criminal activity, including conspiring with a foreign power to sway an election, or working to obstruct investigations into those ties.\nIdeally, Mr. Barr will share Mr. Mueller's report with the country. But if he elects to withhold it, President Trump will no doubt claim victory. He will no doubt treat the absence of an indictment as full vindication. But here's a truth for the president: He was never going to be indicted. The Department of Justice has a longstanding policy against indicting a sitting president, and the absence of an indictment does not mean no evidence of conspiracy or obstruction was found.\nIndeed, Mr. Mueller's report may not be the end of the president's legal peril, only the beginning. That's because report or no report, through his prosecutions, referrals, indictments, convictions and subpoenas, Mr. Mueller has already provided the House of Representative with some very clear paths for investigation.\n So even if the Mueller report simply gets tossed in a drawer in Mr. Barr's desk for all eternity, there is already sufficient material out there to let the House exercise its newly rediscovered oversight responsibilities and get to the bottom of what happened between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. \nRemember, Richard Nixon was not indicted, and there was no commensurate special counsel report in the Watergate scandal. There doesn't need to be one here to right wrongs so egregious they were apparently worth lying about."}, {"idx": 98, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/opinion/william-barr-trump-roy-cohn.html", "text": "One of Donald Trump's more dubious constitutional notions is that the attorney general serves to protect the president, rather than serving as a lawyer for the American people. He fired the office's previous holder, Jeff Sessions, for failing to provide him personal legal cover in the Russia investigation. \nNow he has selected William Barr as Mr. Sessions' replacement, and one is compelled to ask exactly what President Trump will expect from his new nominee. Because Mr. Barr previously served as attorney general, under George H.W. Bush, many observers assume the Senate might give him an easy confirmation. In fact, it should do the exact opposite.\n\"Where's my Roy Cohn?\" That's the phrase attributed to President Trump at the tail end of a reported presidential rant about Mr. Sessions' decision to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation. Cohn, a top aide to Senator Joseph McCarthy, was Mr. Trump's personal lawyer and fixer throughout the 1970s, a man with a reputation for pushing legal limits and employing all manner of dirty tricks to protect his client; he ran afoul of the law himself, resulting in his disbarment in 1986. \nMr. Trump's contempt for Mr. Sessions centered around his recusal and unwillingness to shield the president from the Russia investigation. In longing for a Roy Cohn replica, the president made clear that he was seeking not a skilled and experienced attorney who would help him navigate choppy legal waters but rather a legal bruiser who would stop at nothing to protect him from scrutiny. It is no stretch to think that the ability of the next attorney general to do just that might have been on the president's mind when making his selection. \nMatthew Whitaker, the president's pick to serve as acting attorney general, had made clear his contempt for the special counsel, Robert Mueller. There are reasons to fear that Mr. Barr was selected using the same criteria and that he too shares the president's disdain for the Russia investigation.\nIndeed, in 2017 Mr. Trump and Mr. Barr, then in private practice, reportedly discussed the possibility of Mr. Barr serving as Mr. Trump's private defense attorney. While no engagement resulted, it will be important to understand how far those discussions advanced and to what extent sensitive information about the Russia inquiry was exchanged.\nFurther, Mr. Barr has made statements in the past downplaying the looming charges against the president. And he has said that the president \"made the right call\" when he fired the former F.B.I. director, James Comey, a legally perilous decision, now that the president himself has said that the Russia investigation was on his mind when he made that move. \nMr. Barr was also a key voice in President George H.W. Bush's ear in 1992 when he pardoned several figures involved in the Iran-contra affair, directly undermining the special counsel charged with that investigation (coincidentally, at the time Mr. Mueller was the head of the Justice Department's criminal division, and thus reported to Mr. Barr). \nWe should be doubly worried about Mr. Barr's nomination in the wake of the elevation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court \u2014 both men apparently hold expansive views of presidential power, especially with regard to legal investigations of the executive branch.\nAnd last, Mr. Barr has signaled that he believes there is more to investigate with regard to  Hillary and Bill Clinton, specifically the long-debunked conspiratorial notion that international donations to the Clinton Foundation led Mrs. Clinton to \"approve\" the Uranium One deal while she was secretary of state. President Trump has repeatedly flouted the independence of the Justice Department by calling for an investigation of his long-vanquished 2016 election foe; has he finally found an attorney general nominee who might go down that path?\nThese are perilous times. Not since Watergate have we seen a presidency so mired in accusations of unethical and illegal behavior. And not since Watergate have we seen a president so contemptuous of the rule of law. There are serious and credible allegations against the president, members of his inner circle and his campaign staff. Already the Russia investigation has led to criminal charges against 36 people and entities, seven guilty pleas, three people being sentenced and one convicted at trial. And there is undoubtedly more to come.\nDuring Mr. Barr's confirmation hearings, senators must secure from him a firm commitment to allow the Russia investigation to continue. They must also get his assurances that Mr. Mueller's conclusions will receive a full public airing. Mr. Barr must prove his independence from the president and his willingness to hold him accountable. Failure to do so would render him unqualified for the role of the nation's top law enforcement officer."}, {"idx": 99, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/opinion/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-cohen-hearing.html", "text": "On Wednesday, Michael Cohen, President Trump's one-time personal lawyer and \"fixer,\" testified in front of the House Oversight and Reform Committee about what he says are a variety of shady practices he participated in when working for the president. People around the country awaited riveting testimony, some going so far as to join \"watch parties\" in bars. \nBut like so many congressional hearings, the fireworks were quick to flame out. Even with the tantalizing opportunity to grill Mr. Cohen on the myriad ways his former boss most likely sought to evade the law and avoid his creditors, many members of the committee, from both parties, could not resist their usual grandstanding. \nConsider the line of questioning from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. She asked Mr. Cohen a series of specific questions about how Mr. Trump had handled insurance claims and whether he had provided accurate information to various companies. \"To your knowledge,\" she asked, \"did Donald Trump ever provide inflated assets to an insurance company?\" He had. \nShe asked whether Mr. Trump had tried to reduce his local taxes by undervaluing his assets. Mr. Cohen confirmed that the president had also done that. \"You deflate the value of the asset and then you put in a request to the tax department for a deduction,\" Mr. Cohen said, explaining the practice. These were the sort of questions, and answers, the committee was supposed to elicit. Somehow, only the newer members got the memo.\n[Get a more personal, less conventional take on political developments, newsmakers, cultural milestones and more with Frank Bruni's weekly newsletter.]\nMs. Ocasio-Cortez continued, asking, \"Do you think we need to review financial statements and tax returns in order to compare them?\" She pressed Mr. Cohen for the names of others who would be able to corroborate the testimony or provide documents to support the charges. In response, Mr. Cohen listed the executives Allen Weisselberg, Ron Lieberman and Matthew Calamari \u2014 names that, thanks in part to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, we will probably hear more about in the coming months.\nThese questions were not random, but, rather, well thought out. Like a good prosecutor, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was establishing the factual basis for further committee investigation. She asked one question at a time, avoided long-winded speeches on why she was asking the question, and listened carefully to his answer, which gave her the basis for a follow-up inquiry. As a result, Mr. Cohen gave specific answers about Mr. Trump's shady practices, along with a road map for how to find out more. Mr. Cohen began his testimony calling Mr. Trump a \"con man and a cheat\"; In just five minutes, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez actually helped him lay out the facts to substantiate those charges. \nUnfortunately, too few of her colleagues followed suit. In his testimony, Mr. Cohen claimed numerous ethical breaches and criminal acts on the part of the president, many for which Mr. Cohen himself apparently served as main actor. He spoke of illegal campaign payoffs, rigging of electoral polls, threatening people who had crossed the president, possible witness tampering, and even falsifying financial records. He spoke of conduct in and out of office that would cross even the most generous reading of ethical and legal boundaries.\nAll of these areas offered fruitful avenues for exploration. But instead of asking probing questions and eliciting damning evidence from Mr. Cohen, too many committee members chose to make a speech. Jeffrey Toobin of The New Yorker tweeted in frustration, \"Bipartisan incompetence in the questioning at #cohen hearing. All they do is make speeches, and fail to listen to answers or follow up.\" He then tweeted sample follow-up questions, hoping desperately that someone might just try. He did give credit to several members who understand the art of questioning, including Representatives Katie Hill and Jackie Speier. But it is shocking how few members actually understand the basic function of a hearing \u2014 or chose to ignore collective goals in favor of showboating. \nAs someone who has worked on the Hill and as a nonprofit advocate, I am accustomed to the frustration of opportunities lost, of questions not asked, or of witnesses who are allowed to get away without really answering a question. Often the stakes are low and so the cost is not so great. \nBut as Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings's outstanding closing remarks made clear, what we face now as a nation is so consequential, as the president faces multiple inquiries about possible collusion with a foreign power, that we need more from members of Congress. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has many followers on social media. I hope her colleagues will start to follow her example in the hearing room."}], "Spencer Bokat-Lindell": [{"idx": 100, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/opinion/trump-executive-order.html", "text": "This article is part of the Debatable newsletter.

You can sign up here to receive it Tuesdays and Thursdays.\nBy the end of the week, and for only the fourth time in history, members of the House Judiciary Committee are expected to vote on articles of impeachment charging the president with high crimes and misdemeanors. An hour before signing on to a trade deal with the same president, House leaders revealed on Tuesday that the two articles in question, alleging abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, would focus narrowly on President Trump's efforts to pressure his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Joe Biden.\nThe debate: Are Democrats taking the right approach in limiting their scope to Mr. Trump's Ukraine dealings, or should they be mounting a broader case against his presidency? Here's what people are saying. \nBuilding the best case\nDemocrats should focus on Ukraine, argues The New York Times editorial board. Including the Mueller investigation in the articles, they say, might create weaknesses in the Democrats' case: If the Mueller report laid bare impeachable offenses, why didn't Democrats pursue them when it was released back in March? And why aren't they seeking additional testimony on the Russia saga now? The board writes:\nNixon redux\nThe impeachment of Richard Nixon also points in favor of a narrow strategy, writes Caroline Frederickson in The Times. Like Mr. Trump, she writes, Mr. Nixon was accused of many misdeeds, including tax fraud and conspiring with a foreign power to influence domestic elections. But only one instance of wrongdoing \u2014 his effort to cover up the Watergate break-in \u2014 won the public's attention. Ms. Frederickson writes:\nThe Beltway calculus\nMany Democrats in swing districts that Mr. Trump won in 2016 are concerned that a broad impeachment would imperil their seats. \nSome Democrats also worry that more articles would prolong the process past the point of usefulness. \"If we went about impeaching President Trump for every possible impeachable act he's committed, I think we'd probably be here until beyond his first term,\" Representative Tom Malinowski, a Democrat from a New Jersey swing district, told The Wall Street Journal. \nProlonging the process is actually the politically smart thing to do, argues Moira Donegan in The Guardian. Impeaching Mr. Trump for potential violations of the emoluments clause, for example, could draw the hearings out into the summer, both darkening and extending the shadow of corruption cast on Mr. Trump ahead of the 2020 election. Ms. Donegan writes:\nBuilding the better best case\nContra The New York Times editorial board, Times columnist Michelle Goldberg argues that building the best case on the Ukraine affair actually requires talking about Mr. Trump's obstruction of the Mueller investigation, since it helps prove a pattern of corruption. She writes:\nNixon reconsidered\nLooking at the Nixon impeachment in a different light, Carolyn Eisenberg warns that the impeachment articles written now will have far-reaching historical ramifications. She notes that in addition to Watergate, the House Judiciary Committee considered impeaching Nixon for his secret bombing of Cambodia, which helped pave the way for a disastrous civil war and genocide in that country. \nAccording to Ms. Eisenberg, those bombings were a far more serious violation of law than Watergate. But the related article was eventually rejected, a decision she says has contributed to a kind of collective forgetting: \"By failing to address the lawless bombing of Cambodia and the tragic results, the committee framed how the events of that time have been remembered.\"\nThe moral argument\nFor history's sake, the Democrats have a moral duty to impeach Mr. Trump on every count of wrongdoing, says Times columnist Charles Blow \u2014 even if it requires impeaching him more than once. Democrats should draft articles focused on the Ukraine affair now, he argues, but they should keep the impeachment inquiry open until all of his corruption is exposed. He writes:\nEight\nThat's how many articles the president merits, according to Times columnist David Leonhardt. On Mr. Leonhardt's list of impeachable offenses are profiting from the office, violating campaign finance laws, abuse of pardons and \"conduct grossly incompatible with the presidency.\" Mr. Leonhardt stops short of adding racism to the list, as he says it doesn't violate the Constitution. \nThe maximalist position\nRepresentative Al Green of Texas disagrees. \"I think the strongest case is his bigotry and policy,\" Mr. Green told Osita Nwanevu at The New Yorker in May. \"We shouldn't allow a bigot to continue to hold the highest office in the land.\" (Mr. Green introduced articles of impeachment against the president in July after he told four congresswomen of color to \"go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came\"; the articles were tabled.)\nMr. Nwanevu notes that this argument has precedent: Part of the original impetus for the 1868 impeachment of the white-supremacist Andrew Johnson was his complicity in thwarting Reconstruction; the 10th article of impeachment against him cited a speech he made blaming Republicans for the 1866 New Orleans Massacre, in which white Democrats killed 44 African-Americans.\nThe Trump administration's policy of detaining and separating migrant families should also be added to the list, argues Mr. Nwanevu:\nDo you have a point of view we missed?

You can sign up here to receive it on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\n\"I believe we should move to make college affordable for everybody,\" begins a new, subtweet-y campaign ad from Pete Buttigieg that started airing in Iowa on Thanksgiving. \nThe mayor of South Bend, Ind., was not only promoting his plan to make public college tuition-free for families earning up to $100,000 a year. He was also drawing a stark, if implicit, contrast with his competitors Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who have made eliminating tuition for all students at public colleges (and for Mr. Sanders, at trade schools and apprenticeship programs as well) a core issue of their candidacies.\n\"There are some voices saying, 'Well, that doesn't count unless you go even further \u2014 unless it's even free for the kids of millionaires,'\" Mr. Buttigieg continues in the ad. \"But I only want to make promises that we can keep.\"\nThe debate: Every American is entitled to a free K-12 education. But in many countries around the world, that right effectively extends to college as well. Should the United States follow suit?\nCritics of free public college, including Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar, argue that it's a wasteful, even regressive, idea, since students from families wealthy enough to afford tuition would disproportionately reap the benefits. That's because kids from higher-income families are more likely to attend college and lower-income students on average pay less in net tuition.\nBy the numbers: Sandy Baum and Alexandra Tilsley at the Urban Institute estimate that more than a third of the total subsidies required for universal free public college would flow to students from families earning $120,000 or more, who already tend to enjoy better K-12 educations. \nMs. Baum and Ms. Tilsley write in The Washington Post:\nRelated: \nSupporters of free tuition say that talking points about free-riding \"millionaires and billionaires\" are misleading \u2014 not least because millionaires and billionaires are far less likely to send their children to public universities. \nA different crunch of the numbers: Mike Konczal, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, estimates that families within the top 1 percent of the income distribution would capture 1.4 percent of total spending on free college \u2014 slightly regressive in relative terms, but arguably not an exorbitant price to pay for the 98.6 percent of spending that would benefit everyone else. And crucially, supporters say, under the Sanders and Warren plans, that spending would be financed by raising taxes on the rich.\nBut Jordan Weissman contends in Slate that to quibble about the relative progressivity of different college tuition funding proposals is largely to miss the point. For many proponents, universal free public college is part of a broader political vision to establish higher education as a public good that everyone buys into, like the fire department or library. \nHe writes: \nRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York pursued this line of thought in a Twitter thread:\nAnother angle: The notion that the children of millionaires and billionaires shouldn't have access to free college, some critics say, rests too comfortably on the assumption that wealth is and will continue to be transferred seamlessly from generation to generation \u2014 itself a regressive feature of the American class system. That assumption also doesn't account for the reality that some wealthy parents may wield their financial power to coerce and even abuse their college-age children.\nEliminating tuition at state schools would bleed them dry, writes Noah Smith in Bloomberg. The rub, he argues, is that most public universities receive much of their funding from state governments, and many state governments don't want to increase their education budgets \u2014 in fact, they want to cut them. Mr. Smith writes:\nThe result, Mr. Smith says, would be an era of painful austerity for both students and staff. \nCollege, free or otherwise, should be lower on the national political priority list, writes Matt Bruenig, the founder of People's Policy Project. \nDefending the value of education for education's sake is one thing. But Mr. Bruenig sees the issue as a largely economic problem, to which free public college is an inadequate solution: Both its supporters and its opponents seem to accept the premise that a traditional higher education is the only avenue to a limited number of middle-class jobs. But most Americans don't go to college, he says, and \"pushing more and more people through college will not automatically transform all the jobs into good ones.\"\nRather, Mr. Bruenig writes:\nDo you have a point of view we missed?

As Miriam Pawel wrote in The Times, \"she was crowned the perfect Democrat for 2020.\"\nBut last week, The Times reported that her presidential campaign was in dire straits. Four days after that story was published, Ms. Harris announced that she was dropping out.\nThe debate: What went wrong? Here's what people are saying.\n\"The way that the media have treated Senator Harris in this campaign has been something else,\" Juli\u00e1n Castro told CBS shortly after her announcement. The former housing secretary said that Ms. Harris \u2014 the second black woman elected to the Senate, vying to become the first black woman to win a major party's presidential nomination \u2014 had been held to a \"double standard\" that was \"grossly unfair and unfortunate.\"\nIn The Times, Melanye Price elaborated:\nHow it mattered: Ms. Harris staked her campaign on winning over black voters in the key primary state of South Carolina. But as Astead Herndon and Susan Chira have reported in The Times, many older black voters there have thrown their weight behind Joe Biden, partly out of a sense of political pragmatism about what white swing voters will accept. \n\"Within South Carolina, within the African-American community, we don't want to take a chance on someone that doesn't have a chance of beating Trump,\" a 58-year-old voter told Mr. Herndon last month. (To what extent \"electability\" coverage has worked not just to describe but also produce such attitudes, it's difficult to say.)\nOn the other hand: For many younger black South Carolinians, Ms. Harris's identity was not a deciding factor. Rather, Mr. Herndon reported, \"black voters have largely flocked to Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren over the race's black candidates, because their left-wing promises to upend systemic racism and radically reform the economy are much more in line with the language of activism that emerged after the Black Lives Matter movement during Mr. Obama's presidency.\"\nIn The Guardian, Derecka Purnell explained:\nFor months, Ms. Harris's campaign had been dogged by rumors of mismanagement. In November, the campaign laid off aides in Baltimore with no notice, prompting the resignation of Ms. Harris's state operations director, who said she had \"never seen an organization treat its staff so poorly.\" \nElizabeth Nolan Brown wrote in the libertarian outlet Reason, \"Whatever setbacks Harris may have faced based on her race and sex, they pale in comparison to the challenges she and her campaign staffers brought upon themselves.\" \nAnother angle: With the billionaires Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg waltzing so late into the race, fueled by a surfeit of capital and ego, some pundits discern discrepancies in the mistakes some candidates can afford to make. Sam Sanders, the host of NPR's \"It's Been a Minute,\" tweeted:\nThis is another fault Mr. Herndon identified in the course of his reporting: \"Fundamentally the campaign thought they could be everything to everyone, and that was incorrect,\" he told The Times's Nick Corasaniti.\nMs. Pawel wrote:\n\"In retrospect,\" David Leonhardt wrote in The Times, \"I think her best approach would have been as an alternative to Joe Biden \u2014 younger, fresher, more dynamic and more progressive than him but unabashedly more moderate than Warren or Sanders.\"\nAs the former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general, Ms. Harris has long embraced the moniker of \"top cop.\" But she adopted a number of punitive stances during her prosecutorial career \u2014 championing legislation under which parents of truant children could be arrested, for example, and blocking the potential exoneration of people sentenced to death or life in prison \u2014 that alienated her from criminal justice advocates and many black voters.\nMs. Purnell writes:\nAnother angle: In The Independent, Frederick Joseph argues that the \"Kamala is a cop\" narrative was deeply unfair and racist. He writes:\nAnd as the activist Samuel Sinyangwe pointed out, Joe Biden is still leading the primary field despite having drafted the 1994 crime bill that some criminal justice advocates say helped lay the groundwork for mass incarceration (though others disagree).\nThe Washington Post's Wesley Lowery wrote on Twitter: \"A lot of early in the race punditry around Kamala was prefaced on the assumption that she'd be a shoo-in/favorite with black voters.

(The gratitude part is important, too, I'm told, but we'll get to that later.)\nIn an effort to stoke festive controversy, I asked Pete Wells, The Times's chief restaurant critic, Kim Severson, an Atlanta-based Food reporter, Julia Moskin, also a Food reporter, and Sam Sifton, the Food editor, to take sides in some of the holiday's most entrenched culinary conflicts.\nSam Sifton: Brining is a very wide tie, at this point in history, a dress out of fashion. I follow the teachings of Kim Severson and use a salt cloak instead, what's called a dry brine but which is hardly a brine at all. It's salt and it delivers a taut, golden skin to my bird.\nKim Severson: Thank you!\nPete Wells: Brining is a pain unless you have a second refrigerator for your brine pail. It also ensures that your pan drippings will be too salty to use in gravy. Then again, if you're making as much gravy as you should, the pan drippings won't contribute much flavor. I've tasted turkeys that were ruined by over brining; the meat gets that springy, spongy texture of ham in a can. I've also tasted turkeys that benefited from brining, but on balance I think a dry rub (or dry cure; I refuse to call it a dry brine because it's nonsensical) is more likely to give you a bird that's just as good if not better, and is definitely less trouble. \nJulia Moskin: Never brined, never will. \n[How to Cook a Turkey: A Guide]\nSam Sifton: I have done it often and endorse the practice, so long as you don't cook indoors or barefoot. \nKim Severson: I was so against this, for reasons that largely rested on my distaste for groups of men standing around drinking beer in a garage while they watch a pot of oil heat up and the women do all the rest of the work. But then I moved to the South and learned the tender, delicious magic of a bird fried for about 40 minutes in hot oil. I still roast one (largely for gravy and leftovers), but the quality of a deep-fried bird is superior. \nPete Wells: I'm all for it as long as somebody else is doing it.\nJulia Moskin: Am a city girl. Pass. \nKim Severson: This is bull. It's essentially performative Thanksgiving cooking.\nSam Sifton: The holiday calls for turkey. Duck may join the party, at a separate table, or stuffed within a turkey. But turkey must abide. Tenderloin is blasphemy. \nPete Wells: If you don't like turkey, don't serve it. It's supposed to be a festive holiday, not a forced march, for God's sake. \nJulia Moskin: Refusing to serve turkey at Thanksgiving is like refusing to put candy canes on the Christmas tree just because you don't like peppermint. It doesn't matter if you actually like it. Everyone doing the pageant in the same way is the point of holidays.\nSam Sifton: Sweet potatoes are often overrated. Celery is always underrated. \nKim Severson: No one ever really eats the creamed onions, except the one person who insists on making them every year. \nPete Wells: Pickles are hugely underrated. There should be at least one kind of pickle, and while dill pickled cucumbers might be too everyday for a holiday, pickled beets, carrots, string beans, cabbage or green tomatoes are a good reminder that Thanksgiving is a harvest celebration, among other things. Green beans are overrated unless, see above, they are pickled. \nJulia Moskin: Jell-O molds are part of the rich tapestry of Thanksgiving but they are Not Good as a side dish. \nSam Sifton: Mashed. Why are you asking this question?\nKim Severson: Co-sign.\nJulia Moskin: Co-co-sign. \nPete Wells: If you are deep-frying your turkey and you are not using the same oil for French fries, there must be something wrong with your head. Also, I don't know why more people don't roast potatoes in the pan with the turkey. Roast potatoes are just as good with gravy as mashed. \n[How to Make Potatoes: A Guide]\nSam Sifton: I make my own and so should you. But Alison Roman gave us a beautiful recipe for a tarted-up canned cranberry sauce salad situation this year that I am going to try and I'm guessing I won't be alone. \nKim Severson: I do two, a fresh one with a navel orange straight off the back of the cranberry bag and a chutney I picked up from a great Mississippi cook. It's perfect.\nPete Wells: Cranberry jelly from a can is not cranberry sauce, it is just its own thing, cranberry jelly from a can, and you either like it or you don't. I like it. But for me it's not Thanksgiving unless I see the small round red bodies of dozens of cranberries that valiantly sacrificed themselves for my table. I cook them with ginger and spices and citrus juice.\nJulia Moskin: One of each. \nSam Sifton: Apple cider, chilly red wine, bourbon and applejack for after.\nKim Severson: More sparkling water than you think you'll need, with some shrubs and cranberries and cut citrus to dress it up. \nPete Wells: This would be a great time to make a cranberry vinegar shrub. Not that I'm actually going to do that, but this would be a great time for it.\nJulia Moskin: I like to serve an extremely weak house cocktail, like a maple-lemon-sherry fizz, right up until dinner is served. Festive but not intoxicating.\nSam Sifton: Pecan pie, thanks. \nKim Severson: I like a pie bar for a big gathering. Set out the whipped cream and four or five pies, as long as you have apple, pumpkin and pecan. It stops a lot of arguments before they start.\nPete Wells: Either/or, but please go easy on the cloves, thanks.\nJulia Moskin: Pumpkin, but that crust better not be soggy. I'm going to try Clare de Boer's new shortcut crust this year.\nSam Sifton: There is no place for salad at the Thanksgiving table. None. There is no place for appetizers, either. Save oysters. Oysters are like little sips of water before a race.\nKim Severson: Gravy, which springs from great stock, is the most essential component of Thanksgiving. It is the lifeblood of the holiday and covers the many sins committed by turkey, which always hogs the spotlight. I have gone to the mat on this issue with Julia Moskin, who wrongly argues that the side dishes matter more.\nPete Wells: Wall-to-wall Thanksgiving coverage is a form of cultural oppression, thank you. I'm really going to miss this job.\nJulia Moskin: Choose a menu in your 20s and stick with it. Otherwise you will drive yourself mad over the years. (Change one thing every year, if you must.) \n[How to Make Gravy: A Guide]\nSam Sifton: The whole point of the holiday is to give thanks. To not give thanks, to roll your eyes, is to misunderstand why we've gathered, why it matters, why the holiday works despite the fact that the world is filled with strife and hate.\nKim Severson: I'm suspicious of anyone who rolls their eyes at an opportunity to be grateful. It's the best part of the day. Be a good egg and indulge those of us who insist on going around the table and naming something to be thankful for.\nPete Wells: I mean, see above, not everybody is grateful for the things Thanksgiving represents. Once again I really have enjoyed this job and I hope you'll look for me in whatever my future may hold.\nJulia Moskin: If nothing else, the Thanksgiving table can make anyone feel grateful for having enough food.

I'm ready for a younger person to take the stage, as I don't think the older guys still in politics are quite gettin' it.\"\nCarl: \"I am a conservative Republican from California.

In my opinion it will be sad if the Democratic Party succumbs once again to moneyed influences \u2014 and I think it will spell electoral defeat. Buttigieg's vague promises to 'bring people together' have no substance and, for all his rhetorical skill, he likely will be rolled by Trump and the Republicans.\""}, {"idx": 105, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/opinion/pete-buttigieg-campaign.html", "text": "This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it Tuesdays and Thursdays.\nJust days before the November Democratic debate, Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., surged ahead to first place in the Iowa polls \u2014 which made it all the more surprising that his fellow candidates didn't collectively heave him under the same front-runner bus that Regina-Georged Elizabeth Warren in October. \"For most of the night,\" the Times columnist Jamelle Bouie wrote, \"he escaped serious scrutiny.\"\nSo without further ado, some serious scrutiny.\nThe debate: What would a Buttigieg nomination mean? To his supporters, Mr. Buttigieg promises deliverance from the baseness of the Trump presidency, while his skeptics believe he's an immaculately groomed Trojan horse for neoliberalism's greatest failings.  \nMr. Buttigieg isn't a fan of labels, but, when pressed, has identified as a \"tonally moderate,\" \"pragmatic\" \"progressive.\" In practice, this means his policies tend to run somewhere in between the Democratic Party's center and left lanes. (Some of his ideas, such as his Supreme Court packing and national service plans, don't fall neatly on the ideological spectrum.)\nTo the Times columnist Frank Bruni, he's \"a champion of the sensible\": \nOf course, what's sensible depends on your sensibilities: Those who favor a public option for health insurance and abolishing the Electoral College may like the mayor; those who favor free public college and breaking up big tech may not. \nBut Mr. Buttigieg's skeptics argue that what he himself deems sensible has changed over time: As Sarah Jones points out in New York magazine, he seemed to back a single-payer health system as recently as last year, only to oppose Senators Bernie Sanders's and Elizabeth Warren's Medicare for All plans months later. \nThis reversal struck many as part of a larger, calculated campaign pivot from fresh-faced progressive to hard-boiled centrist. Nathan J. Robinson, the editor of Current Affairs magazine, after plumbing the depths of Mr. Buttigieg's memoir, called him \"a con man\" who \"believes in nothing.\"\nBut for Ms. Jones, Mr. Buttigieg's triangulations are more banal, evidence less of a fraud than of a McKinsey-bred technocrat who might try on a policy for size and then take it off the moment it looks unflattering in the polls:\nIf you've heard only one adjective applied to Mr. Buttigieg, it's \"smart.\" A Harvard graduate and Rhodes scholar who reportedly speaks eight languages, the mayor displays a facility with rhetoric and seriousness in demeanor that would doubtless take Aaron Sorkin several drafts to achieve. \nHis appeal, in aesthetic terms, is antithetical to President Trump's. And part of his persona's \"magic,\" according to the Times columnist David Brooks, is its potential to unify rather than further divide a deeply polarized country:\nJennifer Rubin, a columnist for The Washington Post, writes that his image as a \"verbally adept\" moderate will serve him well in the presidential race:\nNot everyone is so convinced. Jay Caspian Kang, a writer at large for The New York Times Magazine, contends that his allure may be smaller than it appears in the fun-house mirror of national political commentary, shaped largely as it is by white, educated, upper-middle-class tastes:\nOne such consequence may be his anemic support among black voters, which currently hovers at 2 percent nationwide. (It's 0 percent in South Carolina.) Last month, an internal campaign memo surfaced claiming that \"being gay was a barrier\" for him with black voters, a narrative that the Times columnist Charles Blow in turn criticized as racist.\nIn any case, as Janell Ross reports at NBC News, his struggle to connect with black voters most likely has a lot to do with his positions \u2014 Ms. Ross notes that support for a national health care system is far stronger among blacks than whites, for example \u2014 and with his r\u00e9sum\u00e9: Mr. Buttigieg has sparked outrage for how he handled the fatal police shooting of Eric Logan, a black man, in South Bend; for firing the city's popular black police chief; and, just this month, for falsely claiming that prominent black South Carolinians had endorsed his anti-racism plan, which his website promoted with a stock photo of a Kenyan woman. \nIn The Nation, Dan Simon summed up the bifurcated quality of his candidacy:\nMr. Buttigieg would be the youngest president to take office, at 39, by several years. He has so far tried to parlay this potential weakness into a strength, casting himself in the precociously hopeful mold of Barack Obama. In The Week, Noah Millman argues that the mayor's inexperience may be one of his greatest assets:\nBut whereas Mr. Obama served as a senator before running for president, Mr. Buttigieg's highest political victory consists of winning just over 8,500 votes in a 100,000-person town that, as Juli\u00e1n Castro put it, could almost fit inside San Antonio's Alamodome.

How ironic and wasteful on so many fronts.\""}, {"idx": 106, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/opinion/weed-legalization-biden.html", "text": "This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it Tuesdays and Thursdays.\nJoe Biden all but vaporized his reputation as America's \"cool uncle\" on Saturday when he said at a town hall that he still opposes legalizing marijuana on the federal level. \"There's not nearly been enough evidence that's been acquired as to whether or not it is a gateway drug,\" he said, as a decidedly harsh vibe fell over the crowd. \nTo some degree, Mr. Biden may have a point: The jury is out on whether marijuana can lead to using other drugs. (Although in 2014, the Times editorial board wrote that the gateway theory is \"as fanciful as the 'Reefer Madness' images of murder, rape and suicide.\")\nNonetheless, Mr. Biden's position on the issue is simply out of step with the rest of the country: After decades of opposition, Americans started to come around to marijuana legalization about 10 years ago, and now two-thirds of them support it. \nThe debate: For most voters \u2014 Republican and Democrat, black and white, coastal and heartland \u2014 the question is no longer whether marijuana should be legalized but what's the fairest and safest way to do it. \nPro-legalizers often claim that marijuana is a far less dangerous and addictive drug than alcohol and tobacco \u2014 and that's true. But that doesn't mean it's entirely without risk. There is evidence, for example, that marijuana may harm the brains of those under 25.\nAlex Berenson, the author of \"Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence,\" argues in The Times that marijuana can even cause mental illness:\nBut: Ziva Cooper, who directs the Cannabis Research Initiative at the University of California, Los Angeles, and was involved in one of the studies Mr. Berenson cites, sharply disputed his claim. The study, she told Aaron E. Carroll of The Upshot, found evidence only of an association between schizophrenia and marijuana use, not a causal link.\nGerman Lopez explains in Vox:\nFor many, the absence of definitive knowledge about all of marijuana's health risks remains reason for caution. While marijuana may be safer than many legal drugs, Mr. Carroll writes, \"We should be honest about what we do and don't know. We need more research.\"\nAs Brent Staples, a member of the Times editorial board has written, the history of the federal ban on marijuana possession is rooted in racist prejudices about African-Americans and Mexicans. The burden of the ban's enforcement, especially since the advent of the war on drugs in the 1970s, has in turn disproportionately fallen on people of color: While whites and blacks use marijuana at roughly equal rates, blacks are 3.7 times as likely to get arrested for possessing it. \"The costs of this national obsession, in both money and time, are astonishing,\" writes Jesse Wegman, a member of the Times editorial board.\nRepaying those costs requires tackling two main challenges.\nCriminal justice\nIn 2018, over 663,000 people were arrested on charges involving marijuana. What happens to them if it's legalized? As Mr. Wegman writes, marijuana convictions \"can have lifelong consequences for employment, education, immigration status and family life,\" even when prison time isn't part of the sentence. \nThat's why the Los Angeles Times editorial board came out in favor of retroactively expunging or resentencing marijuana-related convictions. They wrote:\nWhat's clear is that racial disparities in the criminal justice system won't disappear on their own: After Colorado legalized marijuana, arrests went down for white kids, but shot up for black and Latino kids.\n[Related: The war on drugs, explained]\nEconomic justice\nAs legalization moves forward in the states, most of the new market opportunities in the cannabis industry are being captured by white people: According to a survey by Marijuana Business Daily, only 19 percent of cannabis businesses in 2017 had minority founders or owners (African-Americans accounted for just over 4 percent).\nSumming up the historical irony, Michelle Alexander, author of \"The New Jim Crow,\" said in 2014, \"40 years of impoverished black kids getting prison time for selling weed, and their families and futures destroyed,\" and \"now, white men are planning to get rich doing precisely the same thing?\"\nThe city of Oakland, Calif., aimed to correct for this inequity by requiring that half of medical-marijuana licenses go to people with a cannabis-related conviction and who fall below an income threshold. This idea of what might be called \"affirmative action licensing\" has drawn support from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Illinois legislature, as well as skepticism from right-wing and libertarian circles.\nYet others argue that it's not enough to merely ensure that racial and class inequities don't compound moving forward; legalization must also reduce them. Cory Booker, for example, along with Representatives Ro Khanna and Barbara Lee, proposed a federal legalization bill that would establish funds to \"reinvest in the communities most impacted by the failed War on Drugs\" by creating job training programs, re-entry services and community centers.\nWhatever form they take, criminal and economic justice measures are already proving central to the fight over marijuana: It was precisely the latter's absence from the legislative process that derailed New York's legalization efforts this year.\nBecause of its legal status, the American marijuana market has always been a fairly decentralized one. But legalization, and the incorporation of the cannabis industry into the formal economy, threatens to change that. As Christopher Caldwell writes in The Times, well-financed weed businesses are already turning into big companies, transforming an \"artisanal\" trade into a corporate one and introducing new risks. He writes:\nAlong similar lines, back in 2013, the Times columnist Ross Douthat warned that what he might call vice, when allied with the profit motive, can have disastrous and unforeseen consequences:\nAs Mr. Caldwell writes, the public health costs that often follow corporate drug industry consolidation risk reversing public opinion against marijuana, especially \"in an age when Joe Camel and OxyContin have become symbols of how corporations market legal drugs.\"\n[Related: Big Marijuana is coming \u2014 and even legalization supporters are worried]\nOn Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee reportedly will begin considering a bill that would legalize marijuana at the federal level, provide for expungement and resentencing and fund reparative programs for the war on drugs.\nDo you have a point of view we missed?

Taylor Jr. and George P. Kent, answered questions about what they knew of President Trump's efforts to pressure the president of Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden and his son while withholding nearly $400 million in military aid. (Here's a guide to the witnesses and others in the room.)  \nThe picture that emerged was of two career civil servants frank about the facts of the story but resistant to ventriloquizing either party's interpretation of what it meant for the president's fitness for office. \nThe debate: The Democrats hoped that Mr. Kent's and Mr. Taylor's testimony would bolster their case that the president's wrongdoings rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors. The Republicans aimed to portray the Ukraine affair as an overblown story Democrats reverse engineered to impeach a president they have wanted to remove since day one.

[The New York Times]\nWhat is a quid pro quo? [The New York Times]\nJon Allsop thinks about how the impeachment story might change now that it's playing out on television. [The Columbia Journalism Review]\nWhat's new\nMr. Taylor revealed something important: a call, witnessed by one of his staff members, between Gordon D. Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union, and Mr. Trump the day after his conversation with Ukraine's president. Noah Bookbinder elaborates in The Times:\nThat last quote is one you're likely to hear again in the coming weeks. \nThe big picture\nIf the president were anyone else, the Times columnist Nicholas Kristof argues, he would be fired and maybe even subject to a criminal investigation. Members of both parties should recognize, he writes, that the hearing only affirmed Mr. Trump's use of federal office for political gain as \"an outrageous abuse of power\": \nBut The Wall Street Journal editorial board argues that American presidents have long conducted foreign policy in ways that serve their personal political interest, such as when President Barack Obama was caught in 2012 on a hot mic telling the Russian president to wait until after his re-election to negotiate contentious plans for missile defense systems. The board adds:\nThe sticking points\nRepresentative Elise Stefanik, a Republican from New York, hammered home a popular talking point within her party:\nYes, but the aid was released only after news of Mr. Trump's withholding it broke, writes the Times's editorial board. Plus, the board says, the idea that a crime is wrong only if it's carried out successfully \"has radical implications for America's system of justice and overcrowded prisons.\"\nAnother tack Republicans took was to dismiss Mr. Taylor and Mr. Kent as reliable witnesses because they were too distant from the president to offer anything more than hearsay. But the Times's editorial board counters that \"this wouldn't be an issue if Mr. Trump were not obstructing the inquiry by refusing to allow White House officials, including the people who were on the call, to testify.\" \nIn that regard, Neal Katyal writes in The Times, \"President Trump is out-Nixoning Nixon.\"\nWhat the loyalists are saying\nThe president, for his part, called the hearings \"a hoax.\" That was the more concise cousin to Representative Devin Nunes's extended metaphor comparing the testimonies to a \"low-rent Ukrainian sequel\" to the Russia investigation.\nJeff Sessions, the former attorney general whom the president forced out last year, wrote an opinion piece for Fox News condemning the impeachment investigation as a pretext. In it he said:\nHow this could change things\nAs more and more White House officials are implicated, Michelle Cottle writes, they may find it harder for them to hold out on confessing information that helps the impeachment case. Mr. Sondland, for example, originally testified (in private) that he had no knowledge of a quid pro quo with Ukraine. But he changed his story weeks later \u2014 after officials testified about his knowledge \u2014 suddenly remembering having told Ukrainian officials that they were unlikely to receive American military aid unless they announced the Biden investigations Mr. Trump wanted. \nMr. Sondland is scheduled to testify again next week, and he is likely to face questions about the incriminating call Mr. Taylor mentioned. Washington correspondent Michael S. Schmidt predicts that \"another disclosure or change from him would make him even more easy to attack.\" Ms. Cottle writes:\nOn Friday, the House will hear testimony from Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former United States ambassador to Ukraine whom Mr. Trump ousted in May in what Mr. Kent described as a smear campaign. (Here's a fuller schedule.)\nKeep in mind: As I wrote last month, the fate of impeachment rests on whether Democrats can turn the tide of public opinion against President Trump to the extent that it is no longer tenable for Senate Republicans to support him. However much these impeachment hearings add to our understanding of the Ukraine affair, their power to effect that sea change will be seen as the ultimate metric of their success. \nDo you have a point of view we missed?

And these companies know it. It's a rare consumer boycott that effectively shifts capitalists' tendencies.\"\nDavid from Oregon commented: \"It is important to remember Uber's oppressive labor practices and deliberate violation of law. When Uber first came to Portland, it created software designed to evade police detection while operating in violation of local law. This company is an ugly multibillion-dollar multinational corporation that does not deserve our business, despite its clever technology.\""}, {"idx": 108, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/opinion/uber-boycott.html", "text": "This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it Tuesdays and Thursdays.\nWhen wounded by the bitter sting of judgment, who among us, at one time or another, has not made the misstep of taking a bone saw to our critics?\nThat was more or less the gist of Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi's answer when asked about his company's fifth-largest shareholder, Saudi Arabia. The C.I.A. says that country's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, arranged the grisly assassination of the Washington Post contributor and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi last year.\n\"I think that people make mistakes,\" Mr. Khosrowshahi told Axios, comparing the murder to an incident last year during which a self-driving Uber car killed a woman in Arizona. \"It doesn't mean that they can never be forgiven. I think they have taken it seriously.\"\nAn hour after the interview, Mr. Khosrowshahi called Axios to backtrack and later issued a statement saying Mr. Khashoggi's murder was \"reprehensible and should not be forgotten or excused.\" But it was too late \u2014 the hashtag #BoycottUber was already trending on Twitter.\nThe debate: Should you boycott Uber, and would it accomplish anything if you did?\n\"Everyone who uses Uber should consider the implications of @dkhos's words,\" tweeted Mr. Khashoggi's editor at The Washington Post, Karen Attiah. \"If one of @Uber's main investors kills someone it doesn't really matter. A representative of a murderous regime can still keep a board seat. When you're rich, your crimes become 'mistakes.' #BoycottUber\"\nTo Ms. Attiah, Mr. Khosrowshahi's comments were the \"last straw\" for a company that has long been criticized for lacking a conscience. Calls to boycott Uber have resonated since at least 2017, when the company was accused of capitalizing on a taxi strike protesting President Trump's ban on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries. The following year, a former Uber engineer sued the company for sexual harassment, cementing the company's image as a misogynistic playground for tech bros.\nLaura Seay, a professor of government at Colby College, tweeted:\nFor others, boycotting Uber may be a way to register an objection to what seems a growing tendency among multinational corporations to maximize their profits at the expense of liberal democratic values. The past month alone has seen National Basketball Association's Daryl Morey apologize to the Chinese government for tweeting his support of Hong Kong protesters and Netflix defend its decision to pull an episode of Hasan Minhaj's \"Patriot Act\" at the Saudi government's behest (\"We're not in the truth to power business,\" Netflix's C.E.O. said).\nIn the wake of the N.B.A. controversy, The New York Times editorial board wrote:\nMr. Khosrowshahi's apology on Monday is not the first time the company has promised, as it were, to do better. \"We should all hope it does,\" Farhad Manjoo, a Times columnist, wrote back in 2017. And to be fair, there are signs that Mr. Khosrowshahi has taken Uber's problems more seriously than his predecessor, Travis Kalanick, whose mess he was hired to clean up. Yet Mr. Manjoo's point about how to respond to Uber's failings still stands:\nIn 2017, Hannah Lownsbrough argued that boycotting Uber wouldn't rein in the company's worst abuses, including how it treats its workers, who as contractors receive no benefits. She wrote: \nMs. Lownsbrough's argument dovetails with a deeper criticism of relying on boycotts as activism's go-to tool \u2014 namely, that they risk reducing to an individual consumer choice what is fundamentally a collective political problem. In Quartz, the writer Alden Wicker has called the phenomenon of conscious consumerism \"a lie\":\nThat the cultural stress on boycotts may be out of proportion with the change they can effect doesn't mean you shouldn't boycott Uber, of course \u2014 only that doing so is a beginning, not an end, to meaningful political action. As Andrew J. Hawkins and Sean O'Kane point out at The Verge, Uber has shown itself to be \"remarkably resilient despite its inability to earn a profit,\" having survived an \"almost comical number of scandals, lawsuits, regulatory challenges, protests, boycotts and more.\"\nWhen it comes to Americans doing business with human rights violators, Uber's $3.5 billion investment from Saudi Arabia pales in comparison with the $112 billion in arms that the Obama administration sold the country (some of which it has used to bomb hospitals in Yemen), the $23 billion in Saudi fossil fuels the United States imported in 2018 and President Trump's continued embrace of the crown prince. \nTrue, breaking up the United States' near-century-old relationship with its most autocratic ally is a trickier project than sending Uber a message by downloading Lyft. But then Lyft itself is no stranger to Saudi largess: The company received a $248 million investment in 2015 from another Saudi royal, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who last year insisted on Mohammed bin Salman's innocence in Khashoggi's murder.\nIf that bothers you as much as the Uber connection, it may be time to consider a cab.

At the same time, in more rural Republican strongholds, says Patrick Murray, the director of polling at Monmouth University, Mr. Trump's appeal has only grown.\nThe debate: Republicans hoping to take or keep power in the Senate, House and statehouses next year face a strategic choice: Run their own races or tie themselves to the president.\nNeed a reason? Two words: Richard Nixon. At the height of the Watergate scandal, Jeet Heer notes in The Nation, pundits wondered why Gov. Ronald Reagan of California fervently defended the embattled president. But Mr. Reagan's steadfast partisanship fueled his rise within the Republican Party after Mr. Nixon resigned in disgrace. This same dynamic, Mr. Heer writes, is playing out again between rank-and-file Republicans and Mr. Trump:\nIn Mr. Trump's case, loyalty pays \u2014 literally. The president is tapping his fund-raising network to reward cash-strapped senators who stand on the barricades against impeachment, Alex Isenstadt reported for Politico last month. \"The donors listen to the president, and he has the most capacity to energize small-dollar contributions by making the case that he needs a Senate majority to be successful,\" Scott Jennings, a former political aide in the George W. Bush White House, told Mr. Isenstadt. Another party official told him that Mr. Trump \"has the ability to turn on the money spigot like no one else.\"\nThe benefits of standing against Mr. Trump, meanwhile, are not so clear. Impeachment is relatively unpopular in the swing states. And his poor reception at recent sporting events notwithstanding, Republicans still like the president: Their approval of him has never dipped below 79 percent, according to Julie Pace at The Associated Press (a recent A.P. poll put his approval rating at 85 percent). In the end, Liz Peek argues for Fox News, the base knows best:\nAligning entirely with the president is a death sentence for the Republican Party, argues Timothy P. Carney in The Washington Examiner. While Mr. Trump may be popular, Mr. Carney says, Tuesday's election proves his appeal doesn't extend to the Republican Party as a whole:\nThat's a problem, Mr. Carney says, because while the president hasn't added people to the party's long-term roster, he has pushed people off it \u2014 particularly white suburban women. Ryan Costello, a former Republican congressman from the Philadelphia suburbs, went so far as to call President Trump \"not a benefit but a burden\" with such voters, warning that \"there appears to be an electoral realignment in the suburbs.\"\nImpeachment makes entirely ignoring the president impossible, but the Republican strategist Michael Steele told NPR that candidates concerned about alienated voters would be wise to give Mr. Trump a wide berth: \nThat strategy may be working for some Republicans such as Susan Collins, who criticized Mr. Trump's call for China to investigate Joe Biden but has refrained from expressing an opinion one way or the other on impeachment. Ms. Collins's approval ratings have plummeted over the past year and a half, but she was still polling far ahead of her Democratic challenger, Sara Gideon, as of this summer (that could change, of course). \nThe only option for Republicans, writes Tim Chapman, the executive director of the conservative policy advocacy organization Heritage Action for America, is to make 2020 about a right-wing agenda, not Mr. Trump's personality:\nEven if Republicans aren't of one mind about how to orient themselves in relation to the president, there's little question about how they will approach their Democratic opponents. Last April, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said he was advising his party's Senate candidates to go on the offense and advertise themselves as \"the firewall that saves the country from socialism.\"\nDo you have a point of view we missed?

It depends, report Sabrina Tavernise and Robert Gebeloff. [The New York Times]\nStanley B. Greenberg predicts that the Republican Party is doomed. [The New York Times]\nGeoffrey Skelley hazards that primary challengers could keep some Republicans from voting to remove Mr. Trump from office, if impeachment comes to that. [FiveThirtyEight]\nAnd over on Fox: Laura Ingraham says \"there is no G.O.P. in 2020 without Trump.\" [Fox News]\nHere's what readers had to say about the last debate: How do the Democrats beat Trump in 2020?\nMark from Michigan commented: \"What matters to me is to leave a better America for my kids. We won't get there without some serious reforms, of medical coverage, of economic justice, of our constant warfare. Republicans won't help. I accept that, and just give up on them. Half the Democrats won't help either. The centrists make promises they've made for decades and never kept. They won't do it. They are Republican-Lite. That makes them to me the same enemy as the Republicans.\"\nGloria from South Carolina said: \"The party has to look at issues that won the country for Trump, like the basic issue of immigration. No one thought Mexico would pay for it, but a majority of people wanted the border-control issue resolved. The Dems waffle on this. \u2026\u00a0I'm an independent and despise Trump, but I consider the need for border control as an important issue.\"\nChris from New York commented: \"'Ms. Price writes that by next November, seven million young people of color will have turned 18 since the 2016 election.' Sounds good as potential Dem voters, but where are they? Obviously if the majority are in solid blue states they won't make a difference in terms of the Electoral College.\""}]}
